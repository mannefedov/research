Rather than minimizing connectivity between nodes in order to get ‘unambiguous paths’, we will pursue the consequences of the idea that syntactic structure grows by maximally connecting sub-graphs in local domains. The result will be a model of grammar in which aspects that have proven problematic for mainstream generative grammar (MGG), like discontinuity and crossing dependencies, have a natural place. ',\n",

We investigate this phenomenon in ASL and establish some basic properties: the phenomenon extends to temporal and modal shift; indexical loci are not usually locative-shifted; Locative Shift may have interpretive consequences, which suggests that the co-opted spatial/temporal/modal locus can refer to an individual-in-a-situation, and this contribution sometimes appears to be at-issue; and Locative Shift can occur in highly iconic cases, possibly even without prior establishment of a situation-denoting locus. We further investigate the behavior of the co-opted loci under ellipsis. In some cases, their locative specifications are disregarded in the elided clause, yielding different readings from unelided controls; this happens when locative specifications can be taken to be inherited by agreement, but possibly also in a rather unconstrained fashion. In other cases locative specifications appear not be disregarded under ellipsis, possibly even with elided indexical pronouns, despite the fact that these resist overt Locative Shift.

Typological work on morphological case systems has provided a picture of the variability of case cross-linguistically. In particular, languages may differ with respect to whether or not arguments are marked with overt morphological case, the inventory of cases with which they may be marked, and the alignment of case marking (e.g. nominative-accusative vs. ergative-absolutive). In the theoretical realm, not only has morphological case been argued to play a role in multiple syntactic phenomena, but current generative work also debates the role of abstract case (i.e. Case) in the grammar: abstract case features have been proposed to underlie morphological case, and to license nominals in the derivation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phenomenon of case has been argued to play a role in at least three areas of the syntax: (i) agreement, (ii) A-movement, and (iii) A’-movement. Bobaljik (2008) provides convincing evidence that morphological case—rather than grammatical function—determines a nominal argument’s eligibility to participate in verbal agreement. Preminger (2014), building upon Bobaljik’s work, claims that languages vary as to whether movement to subject position is case-sensitive. As for case-sensitive A’-movement, recent literature debates whether this phenomenon should be seen as another instance of ‘case discrimination’ (Deal 2016c) or whether the pattern arises from other properties of ergative languages (e.g. Henderson and Coon 2016). Finally, other recent work (e.g. Brown 2016) has examined agreement and A’ extraction patterns in languages with no visible case morphology (e.g. Mayan, Tsimshianic, and Salishan languages). It is shown that the presence of patterns and typological gaps—both in languages with overt morphological case and in those without it—lends support to the relevance of abstract case in the syntax.',\n",

Based on a transcription table, we can directly translate text from the VM which is shown for a page (f16r) that displays a cannabis plant. We obtain clear evidence for our hypothesis by the fact that a meaningful translation can be obtained for a continuous passage of VM text in a relatively easy and fully documented procedure. Although we do not attempt at a critical translation of the VM text here, we gain a first insight into the content of the VM, which may provide a basis for discussions of the provenance of the VM.

While attitude matrix predicates allow implicit control (implicit logophoric control), non-attitude matrix predicates do not. Landau takes this bifurcation to support his Two-Tiered Theory of Control, by assuming that in the case of non-attitude matrix predicates, the control relation is essentially a predication relation, from which implicit arguments are independently excluded. In this paper, we subject these claims to empirical scrutiny, showing that Landau’s generalization on implicit control holds only in a subset of languages, while other languages license implicit control with both types of matrix predicates. We investigate and reject the hypothesis that this cross-linguistic split is the consequence of different types of implicit arguments, only some of them being syntactically represented in a way that they can enter a predication relation. Based on an investigation of the acceptability of agent-modifying depictives in passives, we conclude that, in principle, implicit external arguments of passives in all languages under consideration can enter predication. We show, however, that there is a different correlation: languages which allow implicit control with non-attitude verbs (implicit predicative control) are exactly those languages that allow impersonal passives of unergative predicates. We account for this correlation by showing that implicit logophoric control, but not implicit predicative control can be construed as a personal passive. Our analysis appears to be at odds with the Revised Visser’s Generalization, which holds that personal passives block implicit control. Yet, we provide independent evidence that this generalization needs to be adjusted and this adjustment renders our analysis fully compatible with the Revised Visser’s Generalization. ',\n",

These identity avoidance effects stochastically affect two types of word formation patterns in Japanese: group name formation and rendaku. We show that Maximum Entropy Grammar (Goldwater & Johnson 2003), together with multiple OCP constraints (Coetzee & Pater 2008), successfully models both of the observed morphological word formation patterns, without any further stipulation.

While at first sight, one may  take  the  proleptic  constituent  to  be  an  argument  of  the  matrix  verb  with  the  pronoun establishing  an  anaphoric  dependency,  things  are  more  complex:  First,  the  construction  is \\r\\npossible with a very wide range of matrix verbs, casting doubt on the argumenthood of the object.

There  is  conflicting  evidence \\r\\nconcerning the base position of the proleptic object. On the one hand, there is solid evidence from anaphor  binding  and  superiority  that  the  proleptic  object  occupies  an  A-position  in  the  matrix clause.

It is proposed that these paradoxical properties follow if the proleptic object is licensed by predication: The complement clause involves a base-generated operator which turns it into  an  open  sentence.

(ii) In both cases, the semantic content derived from an auditory percept can be identified with the set of inferences it licenses on its causal sources, analyzed in appropriately abstract ways (e.g. as 'voices' in some Western music). (iii) What is special about music semantics is that it aggregates inferences based on normal auditory cognition with further inferences drawn on the basis of the behavior of voices in tonal pitch space (through more or less stable positions, for instance). (iv)  This makes it possible to define an inferential semantics but also a truth-conditional semantics for music. In particular, a voice undergoing a musical movement m is true of an object undergoing a series of events e just in case there is a certain structure-preserving map between m and e. (v) Aspects of musical syntax (notably Lerdahl and Jackendoff's 'time-span reductions') might be derivable on semantic grounds from an event mereology ('partology'), which also explains some cases in which tree structures are inadequate for music (overlap, ellipsis).

In this context it is remarkable that Swiss German features a verb cluster-like construction with an unmarked 213 order. I will argue that this construction indeed represents a proper verb cluster and not an instance of the 3rd Construction, which also allows for the 213 order. Based on new diagnostics, viz., stranding of VP3 under topicalization of the governing VP2, short relative clause extraposition and displaced zu, I will show that verb clusters and Verb Projection Raising differ from the 3rd Construction with respect to the structural position of the dependent VP: While the dependent VP is contained within the projection of the governing verb in the former, it occurs outside of the projection of the governing verb in the latter. Applying the diagnostics to the Swiss German 213 construction delivers a clear result: The construction patterns with verb clusters rather than the 3rd Construction. I conclude from this that theories of verb clusters and unmarked word order more generally must be able to generate all six logically possible orders, including the 213 order.',\n",

Drawing on Shibata’s (2014) observations, we propose that PSE results from String Deletion in the phonological component (Mukai 2003), which has the function of aligning the left edge of the first intermediate phrase to that of the utterance phrase. We then turn to investigate the relationship between PSE and other ellipsis cases in Japanese. We present various arguments, based on sloppy readings, partial negation, disjunction, and parallelism, to show that PSE involves argument ellipsis, one of the most intensively investigated phenomena in the latest generative literature on Japanese syntax (Oku 1998; Saito 2007; Takahashi 2008), arguing against the conceivable pro-drop alternative.

Classic OO-Corr involves correspondence between an output [X-Y] and a subconstituent base [X], e.g. a derived stem with a bare root [√-DERIV]x ↔ [√]x (párent-hood ↔ párent). Further, Paradigmatic OO-Corr (Pa-OO-C) involves correspondence between an output [X-A] and a base [X-B], where the affixes [A] and [B] share a morphosyntactic feature [+F] which places them together in a morphological paradigm (McCarthy 2005, Hall & Scott 2007), e.g. [√-INFL[1SG PAST]]x ↔ [√-INFL[1SG PRES]]x. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel type of OO-Corr termed Transparadigmatic Output-Output Correspondence (Tr-OO-C), involving correspondence between an output [X-Y-Z] and a base [X-Z]. Under Tr-OO-C, morphologically-related forms share the same root as well as share the same outer morphology, but differ in terms of an inner morphology, e.g. [√-DERIV-INFL]x ↔ [√-INFL]x. I argue that Ese Ejja (Takanan: Bolivia) is an example of Tr-OO-C, wherein there is unexpected stress uniformity between inflectional and derivational verbal forms. I argue that derivational forms are in correspondence with an inflectional base enforced by highly ranked constraints ID-BO(STRESS), CORR-BO(ROOT), and CORR-BO(INFL), modeled after Agreement-By-Correspondence (Rose & Walker 2004). In total, Ese Ejja prosody is a crucial case study for OO-C and adds to the body of evidence showing how the phonology of words can be shaped by morphologically-related forms.',\n",

It is suggested that clitics in Italian are different from other major Romance languages because of their specification for two pervasive syntactic features, namely [π] and [ω]. All clitics but ne carry the feature [π], whereas the feature [ω] is present in third person accusative-specified clitics as well as past participles. Due to the feature [π], simple clitics must undergo an unusual long outbound movement under OCP. However, the most remarkable combined effect of these feature is to be found in clusters of object clitics, which must be processed by a compounding rule (CCR), and then licensed by a phonological sandhi rule (ICIS), in order to avoid an overload derivation (DEN>3). The feature [ω] has a further effect in the grammar: it forces the agreement of past participles and direct object clitics.

Explanations that have been given for these cycles include structural and featural economy (e.g. van Gelderen 2004). Chomsky’s (2013; 2015) focus on labeling as unconnected to merge makes it possible to see the cycles in another way, namely as resolutions to labeling problems. The Labeling Algorithm (LA) operates after merge is complete, at the point that a syntactic derivation is transferred to the interfaces. When a head and a phrase merge, the LA automatically determines the head to be the label. In cases where two phrases merge, the LA cannot find the head and one of the phrases either has to move or share features with the other. I will argue that, in addition to Chomsky’s resolutions to labeling paradoxes, reanalyzing a phrase as a head also resolves the paradox. This change is very frequent as I show in eight cross-linguistically attested changes which are part of full cycles. In addition, in the renewal stage of a cycle, adjuncts are frequently incorporated as arguments and this shows a preference of set-merge (feature-sharing) over pair-merge.',\n",

I propose an analysis of NPI licensing in which three components of grammar interface: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

Using French as a case study, this paper argues that all gender features—even those which have been seen as arbitrary—are necessarily interpretable at the LF interface. Even if a feature does not contribute compositionally to the meaning of a structure, it must be visible to provide the context for interpretation. This leads to an argument for the abandonment of the interpretable-uninterpretable distinction in the representation of features. Instead, the analysis contends that the mechanism of interpretation is responsible for differences in the semantic contribution of features: both heads and sub-structures can be taken as input to the interpretive mechanism. The interpretation of heads leads to compositional meaning, and the interpretation of sub-structures to non-compositional meaning. The system has the consequence of simplifying restrictions on gender specification such that they are solely linked to the availability of a semantic interpretation, rather than to a combination of phonological and semantic licensing conditions.',\n",

We provide a critical discussion of recent research into this phenomenon (Kramer & Rawlins 2009; Krifka 2013; Roelofsen & Farkas 2015; Holmberg 2016), which leads to three questions: Does the intonation produced on yes and no depend on whether the response is positive or negative, and can intonation affect the interpretation of bare polar particle responses? Which particles do speakers prefer to use when? Are preference patterns sensitive to the polarity of preceding sentences in the context? In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the contradiction contour (Liberman & Sag 1974) is an intonation that is commonly produced on positive responses to negative sentences, and that it affects hearers’ interpretations of bare particle responses. Beyond intonation, our experimental results add new evidence regarding speakers’ preferences for using yes and no in response to negative polar questions and rising declaratives. Finally, our results suggest that preference patterns are not sensitive to the polarity of context sentences.',\n",

Recently, this assumption has been questioned, especially for languages without articles (Bošković (2005), et seq.). The alternative proposal holds that nominals in Serbo-Croatian (and more strongly, languages without articles in general) lack the DP projection, and that this difference has a variety of syntactic consequences. In this paper, I investigate the nominal extended projection of another language without articles, Estonian (Finno-Ugric). On the basis of a number of facts about Estonian's system of adnominal genitives, I conclude that nominals in Estonian should not be given the same analysis as those in Serbo-Croatian. I propose instead that Estonian's nominals are DPs. I then propose that indefinite pronouns and wh-determiners instantiate the category D in the language, arguing that DP does more cross-linguistically than host articles.

We account for the difference by saying that overtly case marked nominals are in fact agreed with in the syntax, but the actual transfer of phi-feature values happens at PF, where it is sensitive to post syntactic operations like Fusion. All and only heads that fuse with case (a K head) can feed valuation and thus be realized on the agreement probe. Adıyaman Kurmanji is a language where number fuses with K and this feeds agreement, resulting in partial agreement with overtly case marked nominals (in number but not person), whereas Hindi is not. The possibility of object agreement in these languages is, we claim, the result of Multiple Agree, which creates complex feature bundles on agreement probes that are only partially realized morphologically at PF.

       "              'The present work defends the idea that grammatical categories are not intrinsic to mergeable items, taking as a departure point Lenneberg’s (1967, 1975) claim that syntactic objects are definable only contextually. It is argued that there are four different strands of inquiry that are of interest when one seeks to build an evolutionarily plausible theory of labels and operation Label: (i) linguistic constraints on adjacent elements of the same type such as Repetition/Identity Avoidance ([*XX]), (ii) data that flout these constraints ([XX]), (iii) disorders that raise questions as to whether the locus of impairment is a categorial feature per se, and (iv) operation Label as a candidate for human uniqueness. After discussing categorial identity through these perspectives, this work first traces the origins and manifestations of Identity Avoidance in language and other domains of human cognition, with emphasis on attention orienting. Second, it proposes a new processing principle, the Novel Information Bias, that (i) captures linguistic Identity Avoidance based on how the brain decodes types and tokens and (ii) explains the universal fact that generally the existence of adjacent occurrences of syntactically and/or phonologically identical tokens is severely constrained.',\n",

       "              'Identifying and modeling factors that influence typology has been one of the most contested issues in phonology with two major lines of thought emerging in this discussion: the Analytic Bias (AB) and Channel Bias (CB) approach (Moreton 2008). Empirical evidence in favor of both approaches exists, yet very few attempts have been made to model them together. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new MaxEnt-compatible model of phonological typology that models both AB and CB together. The first step towards a new model of typology is to establish quantitative models of each of the subcomponents: AB and CB. To encode the AB portion of the typology, we adopt Wilson’s (2006) approach of differentiating variance in the prior of a MaxEnt model of phonological learning; to encode the CB portion, we adopt Beguš’s (2016) new model of typology within CB that operates with Historical Probabilities of Alternations and an estimation method called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. This paper proposes a new model of typology that combines differentiating prior variance (AB; Wilson 2006) with estimating Historical Weights based on Historical Probabilities (CB; Beguš 2016), whereby both variables influence the typology. I further argue that this new model performs better than the current “split” models on the basis of two alternations, post-nasal voicing and devoicing, and point to future directions this line of research should take.

I also show that the relevant ‘inalienably possessed’ weak definites are not restricted to body parts, but include a broader set of nouns with a stereotypical function that are located in or on the body of an animate possessor/ location: mental or physical faculties, facial expressions, as well as articles of clothing, protection, and adornment. This set of nouns displays a number of peculiar restrictions on the verbs that select them. I argue that all of these restrictions derive from the requirement that the semantic properties of weak definites and the syntactic configuration of the RP need to be compositionally respected.

I derive the observed distributional differences between languages from the range of values available for the interpretation of this component.

In order to verify them, we consider the following four facts: (i) clause-boundedness of Move-R, (ii) exceptionality of Move-R in comparatives, (iii) availability of multiple Move-R, and (iv) ellipsis-specific nature of Move-R. Based on these facts, we argue that the QR approach is preferable, because it derives all the facts, while the SP approach does not. Furthermore, we lend support to the QR approach by pointing out that Move-R shows similar behavior to overt QR in Icelandic, which Svenonius (2000) refers to as Quantifier Movement. Through these arguments, we suggest that pseudo-gapping offers no conclusive evidence for SP.  ',\n",

The present work presents yet another piece of evidence in support of the view (cf.

(ii) How can hybrid agreement patterns be formally derived? (iii) What do hybrid nouns\\r\\nreveal about the interaction between different agreement targets (e.g. adjectives and verbs)? The obligatoriness of semantic agreement in the singular and optionality in the plural is derived as a strictly local syntactic process which involves a combination of the following factors: (i) the complex structure of nominal categories and feature-geometric structure of phi-features, (ii) the articulated nature of the phi-probe (Relativized probing), and (iii) the order of agreement operations.

Secondly, we show that there are similar bases for grammaticalization for Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ and AAA like whereby they have gone from showing resemblance/approximation to serving as quotatives. Thus, we provide examples from AAA and Akan (Asante Twi) to demonstrate correlations between the two quotatives using primary text research and analyses based on a variety of sources placing the putative origin of quotative like into the collective African context. In doing so, we find that both AAA quotative like and Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ are attested prior to what seems to be the relatively recent adoption of AAA’s pre-existing quotative into colloquial white American English, which is only first attested in the 1980s. We also find that quotative like and sɛ follow similar trajectories in terms of grammaticalization. In conclusion, we argue that quotative sɛ and like represent a common African source of a similar linguistic phenomenon.   ',\n",

This paper presents novel evidence for this idea from the verbal agreement system of Yimas. As a radical departure from previous characterizations of the language, this paper argues that the Yimas agreement morphemes are actually doubled pronominal clitics, and that they exhibit paradigmatic alternations that parallel the distributions of lexical, dependent, and unmarked case on nominals cross-linguistically. The core evidence comes from the fact that clitic doubling in Yimas is optional. Once this optionality is taken into account, it is revealed that the morphological form of a given clitic covaries with the total number of clitics present, even when the sentence-level syntax is held constant: how a clitic is ultimately realized is thus dependent on its clitic environment. This context-dependence is analyzed as a dissimilation process, which applies to distinguish between multiple morphosyntactically indistinguishable clitics; this arises whenever multiple DPs are doubled. The link to dependent case comes from the parallel between the distribution of clitic forms and that of dependent case on nominals, in that both can be viewed as controlled by morphosyntactic context, albeit in different structural domains.',\n",

Specifically, might scientific validity be enhanced by re-factoring the architecture of generative linguistics from a directly mathematical sound-meaning connection to a functional connection between linguistic intention and linguistic expression? Can the operational presence of structural intention in generative grammar illuminate further the fundamental significance of C-Command and Merge operations of the Minimalist Program?  Might linguistic structural intent extend the basic Chomskyan focus on linguistic creativity (unbounded generation from finite means) to a new level of representation  useful for explaining and constraining the inventive means by which the species-specific features of human language are effected?  Can theoretical gains be achieved  by extending the Chomskyan idea to generation of structure from linguistic intent oriented more to the creative generative process of sentence creation than interpretation by the listener? Is Chomsky’s profound attention to the creativity of human language enhanced by extension to the domain of linguistic structural intent?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main thesis of the present work is that there exists an empirically evident necessity for the representation of linguistic structural intent which has been generally overlooked in the theory of language, including notably centralized configurational syntax in the generative program.  We propose and motivate Tool Grammar , in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  A sentence intention is a formative set of decisions for external representation of thought by means of highly constrained, conventional, interlocking structures and processes, which we call ‘tools’.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts.  A revision of the architecture of competence shifting away from the strict centrality of syntax can increase the potential for explanatory power in the generative program.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral specific conceptions of language characterize the TG approach to linguistic analysis.  \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tWhile the Generative Program has not always built on a clear definition of the basic units of language, TG defines a sentence as that externalized communication structure which carries the selective representation of meaning resulting from the targeted set of speaker decisions made for the purpose of effecting linguistic intent. This definition orients the sentence to speaker action rather than interpretation thereby distinguishing linguistic intent from the wider phenomena of interpretation and implication that characterize receptive activities.  A language therefore is conceived not so much as a set of sentences that need to be accounted for, but a set of structures considered in the context of active decisions about structure and representation on the part of the speaker.   \\r\\n•\\tWhile the Generative Program has classically taken as its basic problem to develop a theory of the non-directional syntactic connection between meaning (logical form) and  output (e.g. phonological form), (Chomsky, Sophia Lectures, 2014) TG re-factors the architecture of language competence rather to connect linguistic intentions to output as a directional generative process.  This at once adds an intention generator as a new module in the competence framework and also defines a new relationship to truth functional interpretation semantics and the study of implication.  For TG, the meanings hearers take from an utterance, which are evidently various and diverse, involve a different set of processes from the speaker’s intentional engagement to represent particular meaning structures.  This means that the various interpretations that might or might not be taken from a particular utterance warrant a separate analysis from that of the representation the speaker intended to make.  Another consequence of this re-factoring is that the source of creativity and recursion is moved outside the purveyance of syntax to the intention module. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTG holds that language has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.   Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A broad swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs an illustration, the following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl visited the sick woman.\\r\\nThe sick woman was visited by Al.\\r\\nWhat was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.\\r\\n*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe here incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is one tip-of-the-iceberg example of the myriad issues, far beyond the simple topic/focus conflict seen here, that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe operative hypotheses of this paper surround the question whether linguistic rules are preferably formulated in terms of linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has perhaps not heretofore been fully examined to resolution. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we seek to demonstrate that linguistic theory is strengthened when it inclines toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal is to show that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactual complexity and undesirably precludes the discovery of powerful natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more natural solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax.  TG argumentation, by adding a new dimension of recordable and verifiable data subject to independent validation, thereby enjoys resistance to the view that it is merely stipulative or reductionist and facilitates a new way of looking at generative grammar. \\r\\n',\n",

Two accounts have been proposed: the templatic-based account whereby consonant gemination results from a fixed-shape template and the analysis contending that causative gemination succumbs to positional faithfulness effects. In this paper, we diverge from this trend, claiming that the two approaches suffer from a lack of empirical adequacy. As an alternative, we propose an analysis within the theory of Optimality Theory, with the basic assumption being that the linearization of the causative morpheme is instead the result of phonological well-formedness interacting with the morphological process of causativization. An important empirical prediction of our analysis is that the causative affix can neither move to word-initial positions nor word-final positions under the pressure of phonological well-formedness constraints. This is shown to be an example of the Emergence of the Unmarked, wherein the otherwise inactive markedness constraint *COMPLEXONSET in the language bears the burden of the explanation.

       "              \"Recent comparative semantics suggests that sign language makes use of the same logical resources as spoken language, but has richer mechanisms of iconic enrichment. It is often thought that when speech is analyzed in tandem with  iconic gestures, 'expressive parity' is regained between speech and sign. But this comparison between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures turns out to be complex because iconic enrichments often have a non-at-issue status, as attested by their interaction with logical operators. We argue that the status of iconic enrichments is constrained by two parameters: ±internal, ±separate_time_slot.  If an enrichment is effected by the internal modification  of an expression (+internal) – e.g. by lengthening the word loooong in English, or of the sign GROW in ASL – it can have any semantic status and can in particular be at-issue. If an enrichment is an external addition to an expression (-internal) – as is the case of co-speech gestures in English – it does not make an at-issue contribution, but it may have the status of a presupposition or of a supplement. If an enrichment has a separate time slot (+separate_time_slot), it may not be trivial (= presupposed), and must thus be at-issue or supplemental. The generalization is assessed on the basis of vocal iconicity in spoken language, iconic modulations in sign language, co-speech as well as 'post-speech' gestures and facial expressions in spoken and sign language, and also gestures that fully replace words in spoken language. Our typology suggests that there are systematic expressive differences between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures, and also that the semantic status of iconic enrichments can in part be predicted by parameters pertaining to their form.\",\n",

We argue that the entailment of scalar change and the entailment of a new result state should not be wholly conflated. Rather, various previously proposed diagnostics\\r\\nfor scalar change actually pick out at least two distinct notions — entailing change along a scale regardless of whether a new state obtains for the theme argument more broadly and change along a scale that does result in a new state more narrowly. We specifically examine verbs of manner-of-motion, with a special emphasis on the verb climb, and show that there is a subclass of manner-of-motion verbs that entail scalar change without a new result and are themselves also crossclassified by other standard distinctions among scalar change verbs. These observations have several consequences. First, manner-of-motion verbs are not as distinct from path verbs\\r\\nas prior work in the Talmy typology has suggested. Second, prior diagnostics for identifying result verbs and subtypes of result verbs are sensitive to the various distinctions we propose, producing more nuanced results than previously assumed.

The evidence in favor of this account also militates in favor of a weak semantics for must p. In light of these findings, future prospects are explored. In particular, I suggest that this proposal paves the way for the felicity conditions of epistemic must to be derived as a conversational implicature.

I argue that the subjects in these constructions are actually  external arguments of small clauses (of which goal-PPs are taken to be a subset, following e.g. Beck & Snyder 2001). The differences between dialects is located in the structure of resultatives; standard English resultatives are proposed to be interpreted via a rule of semantic composition similar to von Stechow 1995's Principle R, while in BelfE, interpretation is mediated by a [cause] feature, which can assign Case to the small clause's external argument. ScotE is an intermediate case, where only light motion verbs are endowed with Case-assigning [cause]. The paper also discusses a construction in ScotE where 'away' can appear without an overt verb and with a postverbal subject ('away you to bed'), analyzing the structure as containing a null [cause]-marked motion verb.\",\n",

Contrary to the claims of previous work on the language, I show that multiple constituents can be simultaneously fronted, though only in limited configurations. I argue that the distinct heads C and T are present in Toba Batak, with their common division of labor, but extraction patterns are restricted by the limited means of nominal licensing (abstract Case) in the language. In addition, the features of C and T have the option of being bundled together on a single head, inheriting properties of both C and T and probing together for the joint satisfaction of their probes. Such composite probes are unable to skip partially matching goals.

Based on cases of apparent unquotation in direct discourse constructions (including data from Kwaza speakers, Catalan signers, and Dutch children), I suggest a general pragmatic answer: unquotation is essentially a way to resolve a conflict that arises between two opposing constraints. On the one hand, the reporter wants to use indexicals that refer directly to the most salient speech act participants and their surroundings (Attraction). On the other hand, the semantics of direct discourse (formalized here in terms of event modification) entails the reproduction of referring expressions from the original utterance being reported (Verbatim). Unquotation (formalized here also in terms of event modification), allows the reporter to avoid potential conflicts between these constraints. Unquotation in free indirect discourse then comes out as a special case, where the salient source of attraction is the story protagonist and her actions, rather than the reporting narrator and his here and now.',\n",

However, in older Middle Frisian texts the non-normative auxiliary-first order also appears. This raises a question: is the modern use of this word order really a new development taken from Dutch, or something older? To study this, we have extracted verb clusters from a corpus of Early-Modern Frisian texts.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults show that auxiliary-first clusters are much more frequent in poetry than in prose. Furthermore, no effect of clause length or morphological complexity was found, unlike in modern Dutch.

This thesis focuses on four known points of cross-linguistic variation in the verbal domain: tense, aspect, finiteness and the perfect. It uses data primarily from the Dravidian language Malayalam to explore these questions.\\r\\nPast work on tense and aspect in Dravidian languages (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005) has claimed that Malayalam, along with the other Dravidian languages, is tenseless. This dissertation, however, shows that Malayalam is empirically different from other tenseless languages and that it does have morphology that encodes tense semantics and a TP. It further examines what have previously been called the two ‘imperfectives’ and argues that the first one is a type of progressive. The second form, is shown to be something between an interative and an imperfective. While the dissertation argues that Malayalam, has tense morphology and a TP, it argues that Malayalam lacks perfect morphology and a PerfP in, minimally, Universal perfects.\\r\\nThe investigation of finiteness focuses on the empirical facts regarding the different non-finite forms in Malayalam and the theoretical implications of these facts. It points out a problem for classifying negation as ‘finite’ versus ‘non-finite’, as has frequently been done (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005, a.o.) and argues that non- finite uses of the -uka marker are progressive participles, that Conjunctive Participles are best analyzed as Stump (1985)-style absolutives and that -athu gerunds involve nominalization above the TP-level (cf.

At a later stage this rule was replaced by a rule (still productive in present-day Dutch) that derives verbal participles from verbal stems, as a result of which the periphrastic perfect tense spread to non-mutative intransitive verbs.

Finally, the morpho-phonological side of the phenomenon is investigated.

To derive AI, we argue that, if an agent has options for an action and preferences about which option to realize, then realizing one of many options (e.g. buying a single book from a large domain) is more complex than realizing one of fewer options (e.g. buying a single book from a subdomain). To create a link between the simplicity order referenced by | and the preference order employed in the derivation of AI, we show that the subdomain alternatives activated by | can be associated with decision problems, and that these decision problems are equally simple iff the decision maker doesn't have preferences as to which of the expressed options to realize.

We present a corpus-based quantitative model of the syncretisation of verbal subject agreement spanning the whole Medieval French period and evaluate two hypotheses relating agreement and null subjects: one relating the two as reflexes of the same grammatical property and a variational learning-based hypothesis whereby syncretic endings create a learning bias against the null subject grammar. We show that only the latter approach has the potential to reconcile the intuition behind Taraldsen's Generalisation with the fact that it has proven non-trivial to formulate the notion of agreement richness in a way which would unequivocally predict whether a language has null subjects.\",\n",

       "              'Japanese rendaku is a morphophonological phenomenon in which a morpheme-initial voiceless obstruent becomes voiced when it is the non-initial member of a compound. There are a number of factors that inhibit rendaku. A well-known factor is a voiced obstruent: Rendaku does not apply if the second member of compounds contains a voiced obstruent (i.e. Lyman’s Law, or OCP (-son, voice)). This paper focuses on another factor to block rendaku. Although /h/ usually becomes labial [b] when rendaku applies (e.g., hako ‘box’ + hune ‘ship’ → hakobune ‘ark’), the rendaku application of /h/ is blocked if the following consonant is labial [m] (e.g., suna ‘sand’ + hama ‘beach’ → sunahama ‘sand beach’/*sunabama). One hypothesis about this rendaku blocking is that, if /h/ became labial [b], it would beget a sequence of homorganic consonants [b...m], which would violate a putative OCP-labial effect. The current paper is the first report of an experiment that examined whether this restriction applies productively to nonce words that contain labial consonants. The results show that 1) the OCP- labial effect can be generalized in rendaku; 2) it works locally rather than non-locally; and 3) the applicability of rendaku is gradient: The more similar two consonants are, the more strongly they are disfavored. To account for this gradient effect, I argue that the process involves two OCP-labial constraints: OCP (labial) and OCP (labial, -continuant).',\n",

Crucially, the evidence comes from the behaviour of the object DPs encoded by this agreement morphology, and cannot be detected by examining the morphology itself. Inuktitut object DPs display various properties mirroring the behaviour of clitic doubled objects cross-linguistically, while in Kalaallisut they display none of these properties, suggesting genuine phi-agreement.

These make major empirical predictions, including Cyclic Containment, the Russian Doll Theorem, and Chung’s Generalization. The exposition highlights the fact that Stratal Phonology differs from other cyclic frameworks, such as Cophonology Theory, in positing relatively fewer cycles. Recent proposals are reviewed which look to independent facts in an effort to derive long-standing generalizations about cyclic domain structures: notably, the noncyclic status of roots and the recursiveness of stem-level domains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSection 3 addresses the contest between cyclicity and output-output correspondence, focusing on Steriade’s (1999) claim that English dual-level affixes like _-able_ challenge Cyclic Containment. I argue that, whilst Steriade’s argument draws force from important empirical facts, containment-compliant analyses centred on lexical acquisition not only describe the phenomena accurately, but also generate correct empirical predictions that are not matched by accounts relying on output-output correspondence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSection 4 assesses Stratal Phonology by evaluating the plausibility of its implications for morphology. I show, first, that the theory can derive the relative ordering of phonological strata without recourse to the Affix Ordering Generalization, and that it can handle bracketing paradoxes without recourse to rebracketing operations. At the same time, Stratal Phonology presupposes that morphology and phonology are distinct grammatical modules, and for this reason it favours concatenativist approaches to putative instances of process morphology, in line with Generalized Nonlinear Affixation.\\r\\n',\n",

The strongest form of this model is that all morphological operations take place in parallel, which I call the Morphology-in-Parallel Hypothesis (MPH). Although combining OT and DM is unorthodox in practice, I show that a growing body of data warrants his modification (Trommer 2001a, 2001b, 2002; Dawson in press; Foley to appear; a.o.), and provide evidence for OT-DM from a morphological conspiracy involving verbal clitics in Degema (Nigeria). To account for this conspiracy, I argue that agreement clitics are inserted post-syntactically via the DM operation Dissociated Node Insertion (DNI), and further that verb complexes are formed post-syntactically via the operation Local Dislocation (LD). I argue that both these operations are triggered by a well-formedness markedness constraint which requires verbs to appear in properly inflected words on the surface. These DM operations are decomposed into a series of constraints which are crucially ranked. Candidates are freely generated from GEN and are subject to all DM operations, and are evaluated via EVAL against the ranked constraint set. I illustrate that under standard views of DM in which DNI proceeds VI, a serial model results in an ordering paradox, and that even after parameterizing DM operation ordering in response, this model does not adequately account for the morphological conspiracy.

       "              'In this paper, I argue for a theory of genericity that is based on neo-Davidsonian event semantics (Parson 1990& 2000; Higginbotham, 2000; etc.). I argue that in generic sentences there are ontologically two sorts of things that have generic interpretation: individuals and eventualities. I distinguish broadly between three types of individual: kind individuals, generic individuals and concrete individuals. A distinction is made between particular events and generic events on the one hand; and between kind-level states, individual-level states, stage-level states and generic states on the other hand.  I propose that only generic individuals truly require the presence of the Gen operator and that kind and concrete individuals are existentially closed with the logical form of kind individual involving a type-shifting operation. Also, I propose that generic events and generic states contain the generic predicate ‘gen (e)’ which turns concrete eventualities into generic ones and that the other types of eventuality also have their respective predicates that distinguish them from one another. Using this framework to account for genericity in Yoruba has two implications for current theories of genericity and event semantics. First, it is shown that Kimian states (Maienborn, 2007) in Yoruba have an E-position that the generic predicate (the imperfective) máa-ń targets (contrary to expectation). Second, in some constructions máa-ń is best treated as the operator Gen, suggesting that the so-called silent operator Gen is not always silent in Yoruba.',\n",

The study is based on Latin data, but in also includes cross-linguistic considerations. The analyses are framed in Partial Compositional Discourse Representation Theory (Haug 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin LDRs are frequent in indirect discourse in Latin as well as in other languages, and they refer to the author of the indirect discourse. Given this pattern, an analysis based on the modal semantics of indirect discourse easily comes to mind. However, LDRs are also attested in non-reported environments, which are often treated in terms of perspective shift. To capture the different uses, I argue that LDRs are anaphors with a presuppositional restriction to shifted perspective holders. Perspective shift is analyzed using events and thematic roles. This approach to perspective shift correctly captures the antecedents of LDRs in indirect discourse, but it can also account for other uses of LDRs. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen indirect discourse containing an LDR is embedded within indirect discourse, the LDR becomes ambiguous. By modeling LDR binding as anaphora, this ambiguity is immediately captured, without having to resort to covert structural differences. \\r\\n\\r\\nLatin LDRs are widely attested in so-called unembedded indirect discourse (UID; Bary and Maier 2014), multi-sentence stretches of indirect discourse. In such cases, the LDR is often several sentences away from its antecedent.  I show how UID can be analyzed in terms of event anaphora. When paired with the event-semantics of perspective shift, it is possible to capture the discourse antecedents of LDRs in UID.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I discuss the antecedents of Latin LDRs in indirect discourse conveyed by a messenger, which have previously been seen as problematic.

After arguing that analyses of the plural like Sauerland (2003) and others are incompatible with Harbour’s theory, I offer a solution that involves the following claims: (a) a category of general number exists in languages with inclusive plurals, (b) general number in these languages is spelled out via the plural forms of nouns, (c) general number has inclusive semantics, and (d) the plural forms of nouns additionally denote strict semantic plurality. The proposal defended here only adds (a) and (b) to Harbour’s system, making use of the rest of his apparatus to explain the data. It borrows (d) from the ambiguity approach to the plural in Farkas and de Swart (2010). I argue that ambiguity is less costly in my proposal, and that the more nuanced understanding of strict semantic plurality that Harbour affords is necessary.

Based on French data and crosslinguistic comparisons, I first show that such ‘exempt’ anaphors must be anteceded by logophoric, i.e. perspective, centers. Elaborating on, but modifying Sells (1987), I argue that they can be of three kinds: intellectual (attitude holders), emotional (empathy loci) and perceptual (deictic centers). Specific tests are provided to justify this classification into these three types, the (un)availability of which explains crosslinguistic variation. Next, the logophoricity of exempt anaphors derives from the following hypothesis: seemingly exempt anaphors are in fact bound by silent, syntactically represented logophoric operators within their local domain. This hypothesis explains why exempt anaphors have to be anteceded by perspective centers (their interpretation is derived from their binder); it also accounts for the apparent exemption from Condition A, reanalyzed here as local binding by a silent operator. Ultimately, this means that plain and exempt anaphors are one and the same type of element subject to the same locality constraint, the apparent difference between them coming from the availability of implicit perspective coding in language.',\n",

On this view, appositive relative clauses and nominals have an unexceptional syntax but a semantics that radically differs from that of superficially related constructions (restrictive modifiers on the one hand, presupposition-triggering expressions on the other) –hence the development of new semantic tools. An older line of research (e.g. McCawley 1998) posited instead that appositives have an unexceptional (and conjunctive) semantics, but a very non-standard syntax; in a nutshell, the view was that even when appositives appear to be deeply embedded, they can be attached to higher propositional nodes than meets the eye. This chapter reviews the phenomenological differences between appositives and superficially similar constructions, notably restrictive modifiers, presupposition triggers, and parentheticals. It introduces accounts based on a rich semantics, in particular Potts's bidimensional framework and more recent accounts in terms of 'post-suppositions'. It revisits arguments in favor of a syntactic approach to some 'wide scope' phenomena, following work by McCawley, and discusses various phenomena that have been taken to suggest that in other cases appositives can have genuinely narrow scope. It also lays out some data that suggest that sometimes the content of appositives 'projects' in a non-trivial way, possibly reminiscent of presupposition projection. While the issues continue to be the object of vigorous debates, they offer a particularly interesting case study in the division of labor between syntax, semantics and pragmatics.\",\n",

While the synchronic status of the AVS has been explored extensively, its diachronic development is less clear. This paper fills the gap in our understanding of the development of the AVS while simultaneously exploring the effectiveness of internal reconstruction as a tool of historical syntax. I argue that both voice marking and the nominalizing function of the AVS affixes were already present at the Proto-Austronesian stage. The analysis presented here capitalizes on simple and independently motivated syntactic phenomena: case marking, the shift from prepositions to preverbs, and reanalysis. Based on these features, I show that the AVS developed out of the reanalysis of reflexive markers into markers of intransitivity and out of prepositions incorporated into the verb complex; these two different sources of voice marking explain why the morphological exponents of different voices are differently positioned in the verb form. The proposed reconstruction straightforwardly accounts for a number of AVS properties, including the prominence of arguments promoted to subject position, the Subject-Only Restriction, the existence of various peripheral functions of the voice affixes, the placement of the affixes, asymmetries in their functions, and tendencies in the later development. The historical analysis also has implications beyond Austronesian, in allowing us to to explain the cross-linguistic distribution of adpositions and preverbs and to capture the descriptive facts of a similar morphosyntactic system outside Austronesian: the voice system in Dinka.',\n",

       "              'This paper discusses a new process in Japanese that involves a semantically driven process in which /h/ alternates with [p] in nicknaming (e.g., haruka ‘Haruka’ → paru-ru; hikaru ‘Hikaru’ + -ko ‘child’ → pika-ko). As this nicknaming process is mainly applied to female names, it is speculated that /h/ alternates with [p] to express cuteness, regardless of the surrounding contexts. This study ran an experiment that examines whether the singleton [p] is more likely to offer an image of cuteness than other consonants that can be used in Japanese. The results show that the singleton [p] is most likely to be associated with cuteness.\\r\\n     Additionally, this study focuses on the orthographic Lyman’s Law, or OCP (diacritic), which can be defined as a constraint that prohibits two auxiliary signs from occurring in a word (Kawahara in press). In Japanese orthography, voiced obstruents (da = “だ”; ga = “が”; za = “ざ”; ba = “ば”) are expressed with a diacritical sign called a dakuten (``), and [p] (pa = “ぱ”) with a diacritical sign called a han-dakuten (°). When this fact is taken into consideration, OCP (diacritic) will prevent the singleton [p] to occur with voiced obstruents in a word. OCP (diacritic) has more explanatory power than the traditional Lyman’s Law, in the sense that it can predict the singleton [p] as well as voiced obstruents to induce the devoicing of voiced geminates (Fukazawa et al. 2015; Kawahara & Sano 2016b). The current study focuses on testing the constraint that forbids the singleton [p] to precede a voiced obstruent (i.e. [p…D], in which D denotes a voice obstruent), making use of the new nicknaming phenomenon showing /h/→[p] alternation. The experiment also examines whether the nicknaming formation can be affected by OCP-related conditions across morpheme boundaries or within a word, such as Identity Avoidance (e.g., Kawahara & Sano 2014a, 2016a; Kumagai & Kawahara 2017a) and OCP-labial effect (Kumagai 2017). The conclusion drawn by the second experiment is that *[p…D] is psychologically real in the minds of Japanese speakers, and that the /h/→[p] alternation in the new nicknames created is more likely to cease in OCP-related conditions.',\n",

The statistical analyses in Chapters 2 and 3 also discuss how our linguistic expectations regarding weight effects can be incorporated in statistical models through the use of mildly informative priors, and to what extent the fit of such models compare with that of models based on non-informative priors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 1, I examine weight effects in the Portuguese lexicon, and show that they are considerably more intricate than what is assumed in the literature.

In other words, syllables in Portuguese are traditionally classified as heavy or light.\\r\\nI show that weight should not be seen as categorical. By exploring a comprehensive lexicon (Houaiss et al. 2001), I demonstrate that heavy syllables have a gradient effect on stress. This effect is modulated by the position of a given heavy syllable in the stress domain as well as its segmental count. This entails that weight effects are not restricted to word-final syllables. Rather, all syllables in the stress domain present some weight effect on stress. One such effect is in fact puzzling: antepenultimate light syllables are more stress-attracting than antepenultimate heavy syllables. This contradicts the typology of weight and stress, since heavy syllables are not expected to repel stress in weight-sensitive languages (Gordon 2006). Given the non-categorical patterns observed in the lexicon, I propose a probabilistic approach to stress in the language. To demonstrate the empirical advantage of such an approach, I show that the accuracy of probabilistic predictions is substantially higher than that of categorical predictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 2, I examine to what extent these lexical patterns in Portuguese are captured by speakers' grammars. First, I show that speakers do generalise the weight gradience in the lexicon to novel words. The effects monotonically weaken as we move away from the right edge of the word, which mirrors what is found in the lexicon (Chapter 1). Second, I show that speakers do not generalise the typologically contradictory pattern found in antepenultimate syllables in the lexicon. Instead, speakers assign positive weight effects to all syllables in the stress domain; i.e., they repair the negative weight effect in question. Previous findings in the literature on phonological (under)learning have shown that unnatural (or contradictory) patterns are harder to learn, and are often ignored by speakers (e.g., Hayes and Londe 2006, Hayes et al. 2009, Becker et al. 2011, Becker et al. 2012). Chapter 2 shows that speakers can go beyond ignoring such patterns: they can in fact repair them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe probabilistic approach presented in Chapters 1 and 2 raises the question of how footing impacts stress in a language such as Portuguese, where weight effects are gradient. Indeed, a non-categorical weight-based approach poses important challenges to footing. In Chapter 3, I argue that Portuguese does not offer compelling evidence for the foot. First, the gradient weight effects found in the lexicon and in speakers' behaviour cannot be captured with any foot type, given that even antepenultimate stress is directly affected by weight. Second, no phonological process (e.g., truncation, reduplication, hypocorisation) makes reference to the foot. Third, different foot types have been proposed across the literature because of contradictory patterns of stress location---patterns which are mirrored in truncation, reduplication, and hypocorisation in the language. Fourth, subminimal words are not only common in the Portuguese lexicon, but are also productive in the language.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the evidence against footing in Portuguese is compelling, and I therefore conclude that the language does not have feet. To further strengthen this argument, I turn to English, where the evidence for footing is robust. Even though English and Portuguese present similar stress patterns on the surface, I show that these two languages are fundamentally different. Unlike in Portuguese, stress patterns in the English lexicon and in speakers' grammars exhibit weight effects that are predicted if one assumes moraic trochees and extrametricality in the language (e.g., Hayes 1982). The probabilistic weight-based approach to stress adopted in this thesis thus concludes that feet are parametric (following, e.g., Özçelik (2013, 2014)), and are therefore present in English, but absent in Portuguese.\",\n",

Taking seriously the idea that syntactic heads are merely feature bundles organized into a geometry, I propose that these feature bundles can merge, forming larger feature geometries. The feature geometry thus formed must be consistent with the overall feature geometry of the language in question. Just as intervening features in a Feature Geometry cannot be missing, HM cannot skip intervening heads, thus deriving the Head Movement Constraint. This theory of HM is illustrated in depth with negation in English, resolving some thorny issues left unsettled under the traditional theory of HM.

The first auxiliary is described as expressing 'full completion' of the event, but its use is highly restricted, to events with incremental or universally quantified themes. Using targeted context-based elicitation, we find that the expression of completion is indirect.  Instead, the auxiliary asserts that the event description is homomorphic--- all of its events are both event-mapped and theme-mapped.  Homomorphism requires every part of the theme to undergo a part of the event, and this derives the reported sense of completion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second auxiliary is not attested in the literature. It applies to all kinds of events, and adds the conventional implicature that the event as described satisfies some salient propositional content by rendering it true.  For instance, it makes part of a plan come to fruition.  This plan is presupposed, and the content is accessible through a content-generating function.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe apply the methodologies of formal semantic fieldwork to tease these auxiliaries apart, including scope tests that apply differently to the two auxiliaries.

As a modifier, plural –tul bears the privative feature [plural], rather than the binary feature [±plural] reserved for a plural that realizes a head. Supporting evidence comes from the fact that the presence of –tul leads to an obligatorily plural reading, while a number-neutral reading obtains in its absence; –tul also shows no evidence of inflectional properties. Appearing as an adjunct to nP, –tul shows certain idiosyncrasies, such as irregularities in the range of nouns that it can occur with. Evidence against the common claim that –tul is associated with a definite reading is provided, which suggests that it cannot realize D or adjoin to DP. The major consequence of this paper is that the often observed non-co-occurrence of classifiers and plural markers is predicted only when the relation between the two morphemes is in syntactic complementary distribution, but may not be when the relation is in merely semantic complementary distribution.

We argue that pro-speech gestures can trigger several types of inferences besides entailments: presuppositions and anti-presuppositions (derived from Maximize Presupposition), scalar implicatures and 'Blind Implicatures', homogeneity inferences that are characteristic of definite plurals, and some expressive inferences that are characteristic of pejorative terms.

We show in each case that we are not dealing with a translation into spoken language because the fine-grained meanings obtained are tied to the iconic properties of the gestures.

In this paper, we investigate two sluicing strategies in Spoken Tamil, namely case-marked (CM) and non-case-marked (NCM) sluicing. In addition to the morphological distinction with respect to the presence/absence of grammatical case on the wh-sluice, we argue that the two types of sluicing differ in the configuration of the underlying embedded CP. For CM sluicing, the sluiced clause is derived from a full-fledged interrogative CP at the underlying level, whereas the bare wh-sluice undergoes leftward wh-scrambling to the CP-initial position followed by TP-domain deletion at PF. While we contend that most A/A’-diagnostics are uninformative of the type of operation wh-scrambling in Tamil involves (contra Sarma (2003)), various properties of the CM wh-sluice (e.g. scope, negation, adverb placement, multiple sluicing) can still be described by postulating that the wh-sluice involves A’-scrambling. For the second type of sluicing (NCM sluicing), the sluiced clause involves a biclausal structure formed by a normal sentence and a null copular question. We claim that the NCM wh-sluice is derived from Spad (Sluicing Plus A Demonstrative), since the null copular question can be accompanied by a demonstrative, cf. English ‘John met someone, who is that?’ and Dutch spading (Van Craenenbroeck 2010). Spad is not derived from a full-fledged interrogative CP, and therefore its wh-sluice does not involve any scrambling operation. The present analysis of Tamil sluicing refutes the claim that reduced clefts are one underlying sluicing source in Dravidian languages, and moreover invites an inquiry of whether Dravidian as a language family in the historical sense always receives a homogeneous analysis, given the immense parametric variation among branch languages. In the same vein, we contend that any claim about the ‘principles’ of Dravidian syntax must be supported by strong cross-linguistic evidence at the microscopic level.',\n",

I show based on novel data from ECM constructions and passives and unaccusatives, that it is not the syntactic position which restricts the distribution of men-type pronouns, but it is case. English type pronouns can occur with multiple cases, but can only have a generic inclusive reading. All Dutch type pronouns can only occur with nominative case and can have multiple impersonal readings. Moreover, I show that Dutch and Swedish allow an existential reading when the pronoun is a derived subject (contra Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003)) I will account for this correlation between the different readings and case by assuming different feature make-ups for the pronouns, following Egerland (2003), Hoekstra (2010), Ackema and Neeleman (2016): 'one' has phi features and therefore always needs to be obligatorily inclusive; 'men' lacks this functional layer too and therefore has no restriction on its readings.

Temporal inversion occurs irrespective of the verb being transitive or intransitive, whereas locative inversion is limited to contexts with an intransitive verb.

Previous approaches to this phenomenon, including analyses of Tagalog, appeal to specialized interpretational rules like Diesing's Mapping Hypothesis. I argue that such empirical patterns fall out of general compositional principles so long as type-shifting operators are available to the compositional system.  I begin by weighing in on some long-standing issues in the semantic analysis of Tagalog bare NPs. I show that bare NPs which are thematic patients are interpreted as presuppositional definites if marked with nominative case and as narrow scope indefinites if marked with genitive case. Bare NPs are analyzed as basically predicative. If a bare NP is local to its selecting verb, such as a genitive case-marked patient, it is existentially quantified over by the verb itself, generating an indefinite interpretation. If a bare NP moves to a derived position, it must type-shift in order to avoid a type-mismatch, generating a definite interpretation. \\r\\n This paper explains how a grammatical system like Tagalog's, which lacks articles but demonstrates other morphosyntactic strategies for signaling (in)definiteness, can be integrated into our understanding of compositional semantics.\",\n",

Language-specific evidence in favor of such structure of alternative questions is available for Ossetic as well. Accordingly, the ostensible disjuncts coffee or tea do not actually form a constituent and case must be separately assigned to each of the DPs.

Previously, this ambiguity has been attributed to either the scopal interaction between a negation element and a modal (Heim 2006a) or the optional application of a silent operator (Crnicˇ 2017). Here we show that these two lines of accounts under- or over-generate. Instead, we propose that the source of this ambiguity is located in the ambiguous answerhood for wh-questions corresponding to this kind of than-clauses (e.g., how fast is Lucinda allowed to drive). The current proposal consists of three parts. First, based on Zhang & Ling 2015, 2017a,b, we adopt a generalized interval-arithmetic-based recipe for computing the semantics of comparatives. Second, the semantics of than-clauses is considered equal to that of short answers to corresponding wh-questions. Third, since the use of existential priority modals in wh-questions leads to the ‘mention-some/mention-all’ ambiguity for answerhood, we propose that this ambiguity projects in further derivation and leads to the two readings for comparatives like the Lucinda sentence.\",\n",

The paper argues that the syntactic explanation fairs better than the presuppositional approach. However, the argument is not that Chierchia (1998) is wrong, but rather that the major insights of his theory should be recast in terms of a feature logic, feature interpretation and subcategorization. In essence, this paper is a defence of Chierchia 1998 with a slight modification which only partially separates the distributional characteristics of quantifiers from the semantic nature of nouns. This defence is particularly relevant given that even Chierchia himself (2010) rejects the underlying semantics that is essential to Chierchia 1998’s explanation. Furthermore, it is argued that in order for subcategorization to adequately account for the facts, lexical items need to be stored with syntactic features and cannot be featureless roots.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Note, parts of this paper appeared in a longer piece of work under the title \"Sentential Oddities and the Mass-Count Distinction\".)',\n",

       "              'The modal variation and morpho-syntactic mismatches of imperatives have challenged model theoretic linguists, making it hard to unify them as a notional category. Depending on specific theories, imperatives inherently contain an illocutionary operator with directive force (e.g., Han1998, 1999a/b/c, 2001), a performative necessity modal similar to MUST/SHOULD (e.g., Schwager 2005a, 2005b, 2006; as Kaufmann 2012), or may denote an addressee-restricted property that constitutes a full commitment (e.g., Portner 2005, 2003a/b; 2007; Ninan 2005;Condoravdi & Lauer 2010, 2011, 2012; among others). Despite the fact that imperatives cannot be simply identified with a single label of modality (i.e., necessity, possibility, deontic, bouletic, teleological etcetera), I propose that there is indeed an underlying property shared by all imperatives unifying and distinguishing them from declaratives: they contribute a nonveridical modal space. In this paper, I study imperatives in terms of nonveridicality and polar partition and argue that their semantic contribution is the presupposition of epistemic uncertainty as to the actualization of a proposition p and the creation of nonveridical modal spaces. Imperatives introduce a preference ordering between p and non-p worlds, and are analyzed as nonveridical operators conveying partial certainty and no inherent directive force. Under this perspective, it is not unexpected that imperative manifests not only as a verbal morphology, but also in the form of particles, i.e., the subjunctive imperatives with na particle in Greek, or that imperatives function modally since nonveridicality characterizes all modalities. Therefore, the dilemma whether imperatives are modals or not becomes redundant; it only matters that imperatives induce nonveridical modal spaces.',\n",

       "              \"ASL (American Sign Language) can express plurals by repeating a noun, in an unpunctuated fashion, in different parts of signing space. We argue that this construction may come with a rich (and at-issue) iconic component: the geometric arrangement of the repetitions provides information about the arrangement of the denoted plurality; in addition, the number and speed of the repetitions provide information about the size of the denoted plurality. Interestingly, the shape of the repetitions may introduce a new singular discourse referents when a vertex can be inferred to denote a singular object. Thus one may point towards the first or last iteration of a horizontal repetition of BOOK to denote the left- or right-edge of the corresponding row. This yields a remarkable interaction between iconic semantics and standard logical semantics.  We show that our analysis extends to 'punctuated' repetitions, which involve clearly individuated iterations of a singular noun. While these may initially look like coordinated indefinites, they are better handled by the same iconic framework as plural, unpunctuated repetitions. Some repetition-based mass terms also give rise to iconic effects, and to different readings depending on whether the repetition is continuous, unpunctuated, or punctuated.  Our analysis highlights the need for a formal semantics with iconicity to study the integration of such iconic and logical conditions. It also raises a question: can similar facts be found in spoken language when gestures are taken into account?  We suggest that most effects can be replicated, especially when one considers examples involving 'pro-speech gestures' (= gestures that fully replace some spoken expressions).\",\n",

The properties and internal chronology of these changes are of great theoretical relevance to elucidate issues on the architecture of grammar and the place and form of parametric variation.

For a scenario in which a boy eats some but not all cookies, some speakers regard the sentence as a truthful description of the scenario, while other speakers do not. In other words, only the former accepts the wide scope reading of negation (the not>every reading). One hypothesis of this fact is that each group of speakers has a different grammar, where the distinction rests on whether the verb moves to T or not; this is Han et al.\\'s (2007) two-grammar hypothesis. Certain theories of the syntax-phonology interface (e.g. Samuels 2011) predict that the grammatical split should be accompanied by a phonological split. Specifically, the prediction is that the Post-Obstruent Tensing process in Korean for speakers who reject the not>every reading should be blocked from applying between the transitive verb and the object of a simple declarative sentence. A two-part experiment composed of a truth-value judgment task and a production task was conducted to test the prediction. The result reproduced the findings of Han et al.

Furthermore, I discuss how this approach can extend to similar data from Afrikaans, Dutch and English, as well as to split topicalization constructions in German.

After a systematic review of linguistic profiles targeting mainly English-, Greek-, Catalan-, and Spanish-speaking populations with developmental disorders (n = 880), shared loci of impairment are identified and certain domains of grammar are shown to be more vulnerable than others. The distribution of impaired loci is captured by the Locus Preservation Hypothesis which suggests that specific parts of the language faculty are immune to impairment across developmental disorders. Through the Locus Preservation Hypothesis, a classical chicken and egg question can be addressed: Do poor conceptual resources and memory limitations result in an atypical grammar or does a grammatical breakdown lead to conceptual and memory limitations? Overall, certain morphological markers reveal themselves as highly susceptible to impairment, while syntactic operations are preserved, granting support to the first scenario.

We argue that, despite appearances, comparative quantifiers do not provide evidence for reconstruction, and in fact offer new evidence against it. We then provide another argument against reconstruction in tough-constructions based on special syntactic positions that independently require reconstruction. The picture that emerges is thus remarkably cohesive in that a considerable range of disparate evidence converges on the anti-reconstruction property of tough-constructions. We then consider some of the theoretical consequences of this conclusion and argue that the available evidence supports the base-generation analysis of tough-constructions over movement accounts.

If ergative is assigned only to external arguments, in their theta-positions, there can be no ``raising to ergative'' in applicative unaccusatives; an internal argument subject can never receive ergative case. In this paper I present evidence from Nez Perce (Sahaptian) that this prediction is false. In Nez Perce applicative unaccusatives, the theme argument raises over the applicative argument and is accordingly marked with the ergative case. Nez Perce thus demonstrates raising to ergative. Building on Baker's (2014) study of similar phenomena in Shipibo (Panoan), I argue that apparently nonlocal movement of the theme in the raising-to-ergative pattern involves not a covert adpositional structure, but rather a response to independently motivated constraints on antilocal movement and remnant movement.\",\n",

       "              'The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of resolution of gender values in conjunct agreement, ultimately couched in a theory of copying and nondistinctness. Ideally, as the resolution mechanism is implemented in terms of an agreement mechanism initiated within the &P, it should draw on tools of feature-based computation found elsewhere in the grammar. However, &P-internal agreement is unique within the grammar in that the two participating goals (namely, each conjunct) are equidistant from the &P head in question (assuming it is specified as needing to probe twice). As a result, existing mechanisms such as Multiple Agree (Hiraiwa, 2001, Anagnostopoulou, 2005), which are based on one goal being hierarchically higher than the other, and employed in accounts such as the Person-Case Constraint, are inapplicable. Instead, the closest grammatical parallels to an agreement mechanism with equidistant goals are found in phonology, and it will be proposed that precisely such a mechanism is shared in these two domains, even though they instantiate distinct modules of the grammar. As such, the analysis offered in this paper instantiates a case of Crossmodular Structural Parallelism, a hypothesis about the reuse of operations such as featural agreement, featural deletion, and feature co-occurrence constraints across domains of morphosyntactic and phonological features, and one that has been a fruitful part of linguistic theory throughout the work of Andrea Calabrese (e.g. Calabrese 1998) and many works inspired by it.',\n",

The overall theme of the dissertation is an exploration into the interaction of questions and doxastic domains, set within formal syntactic, semantic and pragmatic theories. The main empirical focus is the South Asian (Indo Aryan; India, Bangladesh) language Bangla (also known as Bengali), which is analyzed based on the native speaker judgements of the author, as well as several surveys collected from other native speakers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interaction of perspectival elements with speech acts have been a relatively under-explored area of study. I undertake the study of evidentials (elements marking an agent's source of information). I argue for a theory that is both syntax and semantics informed. In particular, I propose that evidentials crucially take only finite clauses as complements, and derive their interpretation from a `judge' that is syntactically represented in the left periphery, and that interacts with other perspectival heads both inside the finite clause as well as the speech-act projection. This approach enables a unified analysis of the Bangla evidential 'naki', that changes its evidential flavor based on its syntactic position. In the interpretative component, I argue that evidentials embody either Involved (committed) or Uninvolved (not committed) sources of information. I propose that the world's evidentials come in two shapes: those that effect Interrogative Flip (shifting of perspective from the speaker to addressee in questions) and those that do not, and I locate the difference in a formal semantic property. This formal property predicts the presence or absence of bias in questions with evidentials, and forges a cross-linguistic link between evidentiality and bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second focus of the dissertation is alternative questions and disjunction. The main claim offered is that there is a crucial connection between interrogative and 'whether' in Bangla: they are underlying the same element 'kina'. The surface differences between the two constructions is shown to be derivable from the syntactic processes of head movement and ellipsis. This unification claim has not been undertaken for any other language in the literature. I argue that this claim is also semantically viable, and propose an Alternative Semantics-theoretic analysis that can explain the presence of 'kina' (`whether') in Bangla alternative questions. This analysis, while focussed on Bangla, also makes predictions in an area that is understudied in the world's languages - the interrogative-boolean divide within the universal disjunction space. I undertake a comparative study with Mandarin Chinese, and investigate the locus of the divide in the two languages. This study fits into the overall theme of the dissertation by furthering the understanding of Bangla questions and their interaction with other domains such as disjunction and perspective-sensitivity, as viewed from the standpoint of the syntax-semantics-pragmatic interfaces.\",\n",

       "              'This dissertation proposes a unified theory of Place Identity to model interactions of phonological place features along local, long-distance, and input/output dimensions. Empirical support comes from reduction and agreement processes involving complex, or multiple, place on a single segment---processes previously reported to be unattested. Identity constraints (Ident and Agree) are those that demand two segments be alike with respect to the presence or value of some feature, and are constructed here following a schema of Generalized Identity. The resulting constraints vary both in the relation of the segments in question (input/output correspondence, surface correspondence, or strict adjacency) and in the location of place features in the geometry (within-category or cross-category). Sets of stringently-defined constraints are built via Constraint Summation, a constraint-building operation that sums the violation profiles of the original constraints. The resulting system of place identity captures partial class effects (based on Padgett 2002) of place along all identity dimensions, while augmenting the observations in de Lacy 2006 on markedness reduction and inventory structure with respect to complex segments. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpirical investigation of complex segments reveals place behavior unattested with simple stops. In Ngbaka, place co-occurrence restrictions are an example of long-distance major place harmony, which requires place identity over surface correspondence in the Agreement by Correspondence framework (Rose & Walker 2004, a.o.). The patterns are supported by a statistical analysis of a newly-digitized Ngbaka dictionary. Additionally, in Vietnamese and Aghem, a back, round vowel causes a change in consonantal place on an adjacent consonant, forming a labial-velar stop in both instances. This otherwise unattested type of cross-category interaction provides additional evidence for a unified theory of place features (following Clements & Hume 1995), to which place identity constraints crucially refer. Lastly, complex segments shed a place feature when undergoing markedness reduction instead of reducing to the least marked place (cf. de Lacy 2006). These processes are supported by an empirical survey, and show that place identity must count each place disparity. The resulting grammatical system is powerful enough to determine targets of reduction for complex segments without additional representational devices while restrictive enough to not overgenerate patterns for simple place reduction.

This pattern is not predicted by standard syntactic approaches to the PCC (which rely on inherent asymmetries between the IO and DO). It is argued that the PCC (in all its forms) arises with pronouns that are inherently unspecified for a person value and need to receive it externally from a functional head via Agree. The structurally higher pronoun blocks the structurally lower pronoun from receiving a person value, giving rise to the PCC. The REVERSE PCC then arises due to optional DO-over-IO clitic movement prior to person valuation. The proposed analysis is shown to capture cross-linguistic variation regarding the PCC including the STRONG/WEAK PCC split, which is attributed to a variation in the structure of pronouns.

I develop a linearization algorithm which is locally sensitive to complete dominance, and show how, when applied to right-node raising structures, it predicts the right-edge effect.

The generalisation says that in the linear sequence DATIVE—ALLATIVE—LOCATIVE, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features A, AB and B respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the “overlapping” decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.',\n",

The particles are shown to be heads in the C-domain with topic-marking function. It is shown that the topics typology put forward by Frascarelli and Hinterhölzl (2007) for German and Italian extends to NHA. The Shifting Topic (S-Topic) is situated above the Focus Phrase, followed by Contrastive Topic (C-Topic), which is in turn followed by Familiar Topic (F-Topic). S-Topic can be marked by either C-particles mar or ʕad.  \\r\\nThe particles tara and ʔaktɪn mark an entity expressing C-Topic, while the particle ʁedɪ, tsin, ʔeʃwa and tigil mark an entity expressing F-Topic. All particles are argued to carry a valued [TOP] feature. However, they are different with respect to whether they have φ-content. This difference motivates the distinction between agreeing particles (having φ-content) and nonagreeing particles (not having φ-content). The study shows that the agreeing particles are probes, being with unvalued φ-features, establishing an Agree relation (Chomsky 2000, 2001) with the element that carries a matching unvalued [TOP] feature and valued φ-features. This results in the valuation of the unvalued φ-features of the agreeing particle, and the valuation of the matching unvalued [TOP] feature of the goal. As a result, the topic interpretation is achieved via the chain created by the head of the topic and the topicalized item. The study shows that when the goal has φ-content, an inflectional suffix expressing the same φ-content as that of the goal is suffixed to the particle.  \\r\\nThe motivation behind counting the [TOP] feature on the goal to be unvalued comes from the cases where the goal is the object. NHA data show that the object moves to a position where it gets accessible to the probe, the agreeing particle, following Chomsky (2000, 2001), Bošković (2007, 2014) and Holmberg et al. (2017). This is consistent in the case with multiple topics, where the two topics, the subject and the object, tuck in the projecting headed by the particle (Richards 1997, 1999).  \\r\\nAs for the non-agreeing particles, the study argues that, instead of φ-content, these heads are endowed with an [EPP] feature, which attracts the element carrying the matching unvalued [TOP] feature to the Spec position of the relevant head. This accounts for why such particles cannot be clause-initial. These facts motivate the assumption that movement to the left periphery (i.e. topicalization) is forced when the head of the Topic Phrase is not endowed with any φ-content.',\n",

Since Higgins (1973) four semantically distinct types of copular clauses have been recognized in the literature, i.e. predicational, equative, specificational, and identificational clauses. There are many proposals aiming to reduce the number of copular clause types via collapsing certain types into others. This dissertation contributes to the debate by providing novel evidence from Czech that identificational clauses are predicational and specificational clauses are inverted predicational or equative clauses. Czech provides an excellent tool to investigate copular clauses for three reasons: (i) rich phi-feature agreement, (ii) case alternation, (iii) analytical verbal morphology. Using the three properties Czech offers, I argue that specificational clauses are derived via scrambling of a structurally lower NP over a structurally higher NP. Consequently, I support the inversion analysis of specificational clauses (Moro, 1997; Den Dikken, 2006; Mikkelsen, 2006; Heycock, 2012, a.o.). I also argue that specificational clauses may be derived from both, predicational and equative clauses. In contrast, identificational clauses, despite their initial resemblance to specificational clauses, are argued not to involve inversion, therefore providing empirical support for Heller and Wolter (2008). I also present novel empirical data from Czech that show that the interpretation of the pronoun in identificational clauses is restricted by the copular agreement. In order to account for the restriction, I argue that both NPs in identificational clauses Agree with the copula via a Multiple-Agree chain (see Hiraiwa (2005)).',\n",

       "              'Melodic Heads in Element Theory (Kaye et al. 1985; Harris & Lindsey 1995; Backley 2011) have long been associated with higher acoustic saliency of the headed prime’s properties (Lindsey & Harris 1990; Backley 1995; Harris & Lindsey 1995; et alia) and with the relative strength (e.g. alignment of melodic heads with strong positions and robustness of headed expressions against lenition) of a melodic head compared to a dependent (e.g. Backley & Nasukawa 2009). Following substantial work on the interaction of voicing and nasality (Nasukawa 1997, 2005; Ploch 1999; Botma 2004) it is commonly assumed that voicing and nasality are both represented by the same prime |L|, with dependent |L| encoding nasality and headed |_L_| encoding voicing. In this paper I counter some of the arguments for the universality of this implementation, and develop an alternative view of a unified voicing–nasality prime, in which voicing is encoded by dependent |L| and nasality by headed |_L_|. I show how this analysis is more consistent with both the saliency and strength arguments by considering arguments based on the represented acoustic patterns, positional strength, nasal sharing (nasal harmony within onset–nucleus pairs), and cross-linguistic biases against loss of nasality. Finally, I show how this account is compatible with a more restrictive, recursive view of the phonological interpretation component following the set theoretic model of Element Theory in Breit (2013). Based on these arguments I conclude that we have good reason to doubt the universality of Nasukawa (1997, 2005) and Ploch’s (1999) implementation; instead we must give serious consideration to the reverse option with headed |L| for nasality and dependent |L| for voicing. I suggest that there are two possible responses to this situation: we can either make the attempt to radically adopt the alternative, or we can adopt a more relativistic position (in the sense of Cyran 2011, 2014) which allows a choice between both options.',\n",

The related languages Ancient Greek, Gothic, and Sanskrit share the property that root-initial consonant clusters exhibit different reduplicant shapes, depending on their featural composition. Moreover, even though the core featural distinction largely overlaps across the languages, the actual patterns which instantiate that distinction are themselves distinct across the languages. For roots beginning in stop-sonorant clusters (TRVX– roots), each of these languages agrees in displaying a prefixal CV reduplicant, where the consonant corresponds to the root-initial stop: TV-TRVX–. These three languages likewise agree that roots beginning in\\r\\nsibilant-stop clusters (STVX– roots) show some pattern other than the one exhibited by TRVX– roots.

Rendaku is a process by which the first consonant of the second member of a compound becomes voiced (e.g., /oo/ + /tako/  => [oo+dako] \"big octopus\"). Lyman\\'s Law blocks rendaku when the second member already contains a voiced obstruent (/oo/ + /tokage/ => *[oo+dokage], [oo+tokage] \"big lizard\"). Lyman\\'s Law, as a constraint which prohibits a morpheme with two voiced obstruents, is also known to trigger devoicing of geminates in loanwords (e.g. /beddo/ => [betto] \"bed\"). Rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law have been extensively studied in the past phonological literature. Inspired by recent work that shows the interplay between orthographic factors and grammatical factors in shaping our phonological behaviors, this paper proposes that rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law actually operate on Japanese orthography. Rendaku is a process that assigns dakuten diacritics, and Lyman\\'s Law prohibits morphemes with two diacritics. The paper shows that a set of properties of rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law follow from this proposal. However, since some aspects of rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law are undoubtedly phonological, the ultimate conclusion is that it is most fruitful to recognize a model of phonology in which it has access to orthographic information.

This paper seeks to tackle this problem head on and find a fruitful resolution for it. Two main schools of thought can be discerned: one holds that anaphors are defined as being deficient for phi-features; the other, that they are deficient for some non-phi feature, F. The main source of the problem, I argue, is that there are strong theoretical and empirical arguments for both views on anaphora. Morphological underspecification, phi-matching effects, and the Anaphor Agreement Effect (AAE) provide evidence supporting a phi-deficiency approach. Perspectival anaphora, and deep-rooted anaphoric sensitivity to person-hierarchy effects reflected in PCC effects, agreement, and a seldom noticed typological gap for person in anaphoric antecedence (but see Comrie 1999), argue in favor of the other view. The upshot of all this, is that we have two mutually inconsistent but valid views on anaphora. There is no single anaphor that can satisfy the criteria for both at the same time. I thus propose that anaphors in natural language be categorized into distinct featural classes and delineate what this looks like against a binary feature system for person, enriched with a privative animacy feature. The current model is shown to make accurate empirical predictions with respect with respect to anaphors that are insensitive to person-asymmetry effects for the PCC, to animacy effects for anaphoric agreement, and to a special case of non-ϕ-matching between the anaphor and its binder.\\r\\n\\r\\n(New version: much more compact and has some new data with respect to the 1/2 vs. 3 antecedence gap).',\n",

As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003196 for the related corpus study.

This analysis is compared to that of Alderete (1999, 2001), who argues that Cupeño shows accentual root faithfulness — i.e., that the accentual properties of roots are privileged over non-root morphemes. I show that the BAP analysis is both simpler and attains greater empirical coverage than the root faithfulness analysis, which fails to account for certain attested stress patterns that are captured under the BAP analysis. Thus reanalyzed, Cupeño has two important typological implications. First, without support from Cupeño, root faithfulness may be unattested as a feature of lexical accent systems. Second, Cupeño provides a clear typological parallel for the ancient IE languages on the basis of which the BAP was posited — in particular, Vedic Sanskrit — as well as for Hittite, where I argue that it is also operative. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis of Hittite stress advanced in this dissertation is the first systematic attempt at a synchronic generative treatment of its word stress patterns. Having established that stress\\r\\nassignment in Hittite inflection is governed by the BAP, I also adduce evidence for accentual\\r\\ndominance — i.e., morphemes whose accentual specification “overrides” the BAP. I propose that accentual dominance in Hittite is a consequence of morphological headedness: the lexical\\r\\naccent of the word’s head morpheme is privileged in Hittite, just as Revithiadou (1999) has\\r\\nargued for other lexical accent systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, this dissertation addresses the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word-prosodic system. Hittite and the other Anatolian languages are not traditionally viewed as important sources for the reconstruction of this system; however, I contend that the BAP is reconstructible for PIE and that — against this traditional view — this reconstruction depends\\r\\ncrucially on the Anatolian evidence, which converges with Vedic Sanskrit in this respect.',\n",

I argue that, whilst subject topicalisation is generally permitted in all constructions, subject questioning is restricted (see Bauer 1993, 1997). More specifically, I claim that subject questioning is permitted in verbal and prepositional predicate constructions, but prohibited in nominal predicate constructions, all else being equal (see also de Lacy 1999). I review two existing types of analysis to account for this, which I refer to as the cleft + headless relative clause analysis and the complementary distribution analysis, pointing out various issues before proposing a novel analysis. I propose that Māori questions are cleft structures but ones where the embedded clause is a focus construction rather than a relative clause (see Belletti 2008, 2012, 2015). I also propose that subject questioning is prohibited in nominal predicate constructions due to intervention by the nominal predicate phrase. My analysis suggests that topicalisation and focus/question movement in Māori are triggered by A-features rather than A’-features. I discuss the use of A-features in formally encoding topicalisation and focus/questioning from an emergentist perspective, i.e. one where formal features are not innately pre-specified but rather emerge during language acquisition guided by the Third Factor cognitive bias to ‘Maximise Minimal Means’ (Biberauer 2017; Biberauer & Roberts 2015, 2017). *COMMENTS WELCOME!*',\n",

Amount Relatives are a form of non-intersective relative clause that is usually associated with amount interpretations . For example, the sentence it will take us the rest of our lives to drink the champagne they spilled that evening is most naturally interpreted as referring to an amount of champagne, and not any particular champagne. Previous accounts of Amount Relatives have converged in appealing to degree semantics in order to extract an amount from the relative clause, suggesting that the embedded CP denotes a property of degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dissertation advocates a more nuanced view of Amount Relatives across languages. I propose that natural languages allow two different strategies for deriving amount interpretations of relative clauses: a degree-based strategy and a degree-less strategy, where degree semantics does not come into play at all. It is argued that while some languages employ both strategies, as is the case with Spanish, languages like English only have the degree-less strategy, contra much of the previous literature. Evidence for this division comes from the fact that Amount Relatives in Spanish, but not English, pass independently-motivated diagnostics of degree-related operations (e.g. degree-quantification and degree-abstraction).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first part of the dissertation, I propose a novel means of arriving at amount interpretations for relative clauses in languages like English, which lack the degree-based strategy to derive such meanings. The account exploits the correlation between kind and amount readings of relative clauses in English, first noted by Carlson 1977. Amount Relatives in English will be argued to be a sub-case of kind-referring relative clauses and an analysis that derives amounts from (sub)kinds is presented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second, more sizable portion of the dissertation examines Amount Relatives in Spanish, which can be shown to make use of a degree-based strategy for deriving amount readings, as they do show all the hallmarks of degree constructions. Moreover, the language allows amount interpretations more readily, in more environments and with more diverse forms than languages like English. I will provide a compositional analysis of Spanish Amount Relatives in their various forms, with the goal of understanding (i) what syntactic and semantic pieces are implicated in extracting an amount from a relative clause structure and (ii) how different permutations of these pieces could result in semantic variation within and across languages.',\n",

These phenomena provide novel evidence for the Cinque hierarchy (Cinque 1999), for a syntactic distinction between sentence adverbs and predicate adverbs (Jackendoff 1972) and for an intraposition analysis of adverb extraposition (Barbiers 1995, 2001). Other findings are the syntactic defectivity of finite CP-complements of the bridge verb willen 'want. As opposed to CP-complements of denken 'think' such complements lack all layers of the Cinque hierarchy above ModVolition and they lack a ForceP layer. The analysis proposed in this paper explains why in the complement of denken 'think' only speech act adverbs can take matrix scope, while in the complement of willen 'want' only volitional adverbs can take matrix scope. It also explains why the types of adverbs that can raise overtly depend on the type of matrix bridge verb and why (partial) Wh-doubling and Neg-raising are possible with matrix verb denken but not with matrix verb willen. Finally, it explains why sentence adverbs can be extraposed while predicate adverbs cannot, and why predicate adverbs used as sentence adverbs need to be augmented with a participle or with genoeg 'enough'.\\r\\n\",\n",

Early generative approaches accounted for systematic gaps through a combination of two factors: constraints on underlying representations in the lexicon; and phonological rules. Contrasting with this view, Optimality Theory has been guided by the idea that phonological generalizations are captured not in the lexicon but rather on the surface or in the mapping from URs to surface forms. The view that there are no constraints on URs is often referred to as Richness of the Base (ROTB), and it is a central tenet of OT.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal in this note is to re-open the question of whether OT requires constraints on URs and offer a learnability argument supporting an affirmative answer, thus arguing against ROTB. We start by examining the extant literature on learning in OT and argue that the learners proposed there overgeneralize (by treating some systematic gaps as accidental), undergeneralize (by treating some accidental gaps as systematic), or both. We then discuss a different approach to learning, compression-based learning, that is the only approach currently available that can handle the data in principle without over- or undergeneralization. We show that compression-based learning learns certain naturally-occurring patterns, but crucially only if it rejects ROTB and employs language-specific constraints on URs.',\n",

We claim that (i) the mechanism for concord is uniform across the grammars of natural languages and (ii) the overt manifestation of concord is suppressed by the intervention of phasal domains. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen adjectives in a language show concord with the noun they modify, concord morphology usually involves the full set of features of that noun (e.g. gender, number and case). However, there are also languages in which concord targets only a subset of morphosyntactic features of the head noun. We observe that feature combinations that enter into concord in such languages are not random. We show that this observation can be explained with a theory of concord that has the following properties: (i) concord is obligatory whenever phasal domains are inactive (the obligatoriness claim) and (ii) languages that lack concord have phasal Noun Phrase (the phase claim). We provide evidence supporting these claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obligatoriness claim leads to two predictions: (1) idiosyncratic gender languages are gender concord languages and (2) languages with pluralia tantum nouns are plural concord languages. We show that these predictions are empirically supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phase claim implies that a language lacks overt manifestation of concord only if it has a phasal NP. We show that, due to the phasal status of NP, non-concord languages exhibit the following properties: (1) AP movement out of NP is not possible, (2) the Num head need not be obligatory in the extended projection of a noun (leading to number neutrality) and (3) nominal inflectional elements can be shared between coordinated nouns.

In typical DOM patterns, objects higher in animacy and/or definiteness receive additional morphological marking and appear in higher syntactic positions. In Fijian, however, pronoun and proper name objects, although higher on standard DOM hierarchies, must remain verb-adjacent and are morphologically reduced. This paper shows that this pattern arises because pronoun and proper name objects undergo morphological merger with the verb at PF, which may license a nominal (Levin 2015; Branan 2017). I provide evidence that, in contrast, common noun objects in Fijian are structurally reduced, and so do not need this licensing. As a result, Fijian provides support for an approach to DOM in which objects higher in definiteness/animacy have an additional licensing need (e.g. Massam 2001; Danon 2006; Ormazabal and Romero 2013; Kalin 2016).

Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest that the Chinese bare predicates are likely to possess a tense node with a Future/Non-Future distinction. I further suggest that Tense is a universal functional category that possesses a binary feature distinction, with a split between either Past/Non-Past or Future/Non-Future: all languages have a Tense Phrase in their hierarchical structure, although some languages lack overt marking of tense on nominals or verbs (or both). A new theory of tense is needed to account for the cross-linguistic variation on the surface form and the underlying homogeneity of temporal reference in language.

All three of these phenomena, I claim, are universally constrained by the following generalization:  No Vocabulary-Insertion rule can apply both to an unmarked core-case (nominative or absolutive) and to an inherent case (dative, instrumental, locative, etc.) without also applying to a dependent core-case (ergative or accusative).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis generalization traces back to work by Baerman et al. (2005) and Caha (2009) on syncretism, by McFadden (2014) on stem allomorphy, and by Smith et al. (2016) on suppletion. However, most of these works, albeit largely consistent with each other, invoke some or other distinctive qualification or supplementation to the general pattern. Here I argue, in contrast, that such divergences are not empirically warranted, and that the match between the patterns of the three phenomena is indeed perfect or nearly so. This argument rests, most notably, on a critique of Caha’s (2009) proposals concerning several other supposed *ABA universals in syncretisms with or among inherent cases. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext, drawing again on Caha (2009), I interpret the *ABA patterns referenced above as evidence for a containment hierarchy [[[UNMARKED] DEPENDENT] INHERENT]. I then observe that the lightest cases in this containment hierarchy, i.e. nominative and absolutive, are also the same cases that are given “elsewhere” status in Marantz’ (1991) configurational theory of case assignment. This suggests that there may be a structural economy principle at work, whereby additional case layers such as those of dependent and inherent cases may only be deployed when the lighter unmarked cases are, in a sense to be made precise, “not enough.”',\n",

       "              'This paper addresses one of the most contested issues in phonology: the derivation of phono- logical typology. I present a new model for deriving phonological typology within the Channel Bias approach. First, a new subdivision of natural processes is proposed: non-natural processes are divided into unmotivated and unnatural. The central topic of the paper is an unnatural alternation: post-nasal devoicing. I argue that in all reported cases, post-nasal devoicing does not derive from a single unnatural sound change (as claimed in some individual accounts of the data), but rather from a combination of three sound changes, each of which is natural and moti- vated. By showing that one of the rare cases of unnatural sound change reported actually arises through a combination of natural sound changes, we can maintain the long-held position that any single instance of sound change has to be natural. Based on several discussed cases, I propose a new diachronic model for explaining unnatural phenomena: the Blurring Process. Additionally, I provide a proof establishing the minimal sound changes required for an unmotivated/unnatural process to arise. The Blurring Process and Minimal Sound Change Requirement result in a model that probabilistically predicts typology within the Channel Bias approach. This paper also introduces the concept of Historical Probabilities of Alternations (Pχ) and presents a groundwork for their estimation called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. The ultimate goal of the new model is to quantify the influences of Channel Bias on phonological typology.',\n",

Even though natural language has expressions over higher types, these expressions cannot be represented as traces, which only range over individual types. I call this constraint the Trace Interpretation Constraint. The novel empirical motivation for this constraint comes from a detailed investigation of movement targeting DPs that denote properties, a kind of higher-type expression. I observe that such movement obligatorily reconstructs and argue that the absence of nonreconstructed readings entails that movement cannot map onto traces ranging over properties. This investigation is complemented by existing and novel arguments against traces ranging over generalized quantifiers, another kind of higher-type expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second core claim of this dissertation is that the Trace Interpretation Constraint cannot be circumvented by type shifting an individual-type trace into a higher type, which I call the Trace Rigidity Principle. I show that there is a class of expressions that cannot be type shifted into property denotations, namely anaphoric definite descriptions, and argue that this class of expressions properly includes traces under Trace Conversion, thereby providing independent support for the Trace Rigidity Principle. According to the Trace Interpretation Constraint and the Trace Rigidity Principle, movement is tightly restricted in how it can be semantically interpreted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dissertation also explores the dichotomy between the two representations permitted by the Trace Interpretation Constraint: leaving an individual-type trace and reconstruction. I develop a syntax and semantics of movement under which this choice is not free, but deterministic and does not require special LF interpretation rules. Therefore, a given movement derivation maps onto one and only one semantic representation. I argue that a deterministic system of movement requires multidominant representations. I demonstrate that this system of movement accounts for a number of disparate reconstruction phenomena without further ado.',\n",

Strikingly, in both cases the object agreement marker can be disregarded under ellipsis and under the focus-sensitive particle only, a behavior which is shared with phi-features in spoken language – and is not entirely reducible to the presuppositional nature of the marker.

In this article I argue against this hypothesis by critically reanalyzing the original arguments for PredP (coordination of unlikes, movement of the predicate, case marking on the predicate, etc.), examining whether there is any semantic support for mediated predication and reviewing the putative cross-linguistic evidence for overt equivalence of Pred0. I first demonstrate that the facts that used to be taken as requiring the presence of a functional head in small clauses can now be accounted for by independently needed assumptions, such as Raising to Object and semantic types. I then show that standard Montagovian semantics treating NPs, APs and PPs as unsaturated functions does not require a mediating projection and that alternative attempts to endow Pred0 with some interpretation either fail or cannot be used as motivation for postulating such a mediating projection. Finally, I address copular particles and other \"overt predicators\", providing evidence that their syntax is different from that expected of Pred0 in nontrivial ways, which means that they also cannot be taken as prima facie evidence for its postulation. I sketch an alternative theory linking the use of predicative particles to nominal predication and provide evidence for it from cross-linguistic lexicalization patterns of copular particles. To summarize, neither theory-internal considerations nor cross-linguistic data require the presence of a mediating functional head in small clauses, and therefore the PredP hypothesis should probably be abandoned.',\n",

Much has been written about individual anaphora, but less attention has been paid to propositional anaphora. This dissertation is a comprehensive examination of propositional anaphora, which I argue behaves like anaphora in other domains, is conditioned by semantic factors, and is not conditioned by purely syntactic factors nor by the at-issue status of a proposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI begin by introducing the concepts of anaphora and propositions, and then I discuss the various words of English which can have this function: this, that, it, which, so, as, and the null complement anaphor. I then compare anaphora to propositions with anaphora in other domains, including individual, temporal, and modal anaphora. I show that the same features which are characteristic of these other domains are exhibited by propositional anaphora as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then present data on a wide variety of syntactic constructions—including sub-\\r\\nclausal, monoclausal, multiclausal, and multisentential constructions—noting which license anaphoric reference to propositions. On the basis of this expanded empirical domain, I argue that anaphoric reference to a proposition is licensed not by any syntactic category or movement but rather by the operators which take propositions as arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this generalization in hand, I turn to how such facts can be formally modeled: I review existing systems which track anaphora and/or which make use of propositional variables, and then introduce a new formalism which incorporates insights from these existing systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I turn to the interaction between a proposition’s availability for anaphoric reference and its discourse status (in particular, its at-issue status). Contrary to the prevailing assumption in the literature, I argue that there is no tight linking between these two properties, and that one of the tests frequently used to diagnose at-issueness in fact diagnoses only anaphoric availability.

       "              'This dissertation is concerned with how elliptical sentences are generated. To be specific, I investigate when and in what module ellipsis occurs, and what is elided as a result of ellipsis. With regard to the first research question, I propose that XP ellipsis occurs as soon as all the featural requirements of the licensor of XP ellipsis are satisfied during the derivation, rather than in the other modules. An important consequence of this proposal is that the point of XP ellipsis can vary depending on the derivational point where all the featural requirements of the licensor are satisfied in narrow syntax. Concerning the second research question, I suggest that ellipsis is a syntactic operation that eliminates phonological feature matrices of lexical items inside the ellipsis site, preserving the formal feature matrices. Segmental content (i.e. phonological features) is inserted into the phonological feature matrices when lexical items are sent to PF after Spell-out. This insertion does not apply to lexical items whose phonological feature matrices are eliminated, since there is no appropriate venue which segmental content is inserted into. Thus, they are not pronounced. This implies that even though narrow syntax cannot look into the information of the segmental content inside the phonological feature matrices, it can make reference to the phonological feature matrices in lexical items. This proposal is supported by the fact that elements whose phonological feature matrices have been eliminated can take part in further formal operations that occur after ellipsis, since they still contain formal features. However, unlike the other lexical items, elided interrogative wh-phrases do not seem to participate in formal operation occurring after ellipsis. In order to resolve this puzzle, I suggest a prosodic requirement questions must obey, adopting and modifying Richards’ (2016) Contiguity Theory. ',\n",

The generalisation says that in the linear sequence dative—allative—locative, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features a, ab and b respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the “overlapping” decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.',\n",

Such objects denote properties, and restrict, rather than saturate, predicates. Non-canonical objects are thus identified as event kind-classifying elements. Four properties of such objects motivate this analysis. They are never in the form of a pronoun, and never admit comparison; their hosting predicate encodes a subclass of an event kind, and the event is subject to an institutionalization constraint. Such objects are thus not arguments or adverbials. The paper further claims that since these properties are also found in cognate objects and weak definites in English, these two types of nominals are also event kind-classifying elements.

It is first illustrated that null clausal arguments have underlying syntactic structures that are subject to ellipsis. The main and novel observation for this claim is that null clausal arguments exhibit the effect of the parallelism constraint that other ellipsis constructions like verb phrase ellipsis are also subject to, along the line with Takahashi (2013, “A Note on Parallelism for Elliptic Arguments,” Proceedings of Formal Approaches to Japanese Linguistics 6, MITWPL). It then examines a hitherto unexplored construction, called antecedent-contained clausal argument ellipsis, where a null clausal argument appears to be properly contained by its antecedent. Although the construction can be readily accommodated by assuming the ellipsis process that directly elides arguments (argument ellipsis), it raises serious difficulties for its alternative analysis that employs the ellipsis process targeting a VP whose head has evacuated it (verb-stranding VP-ellipsis). This paper thus provides a novel case where the argument ellipsis analysis is required, no matter how well the verb-stranding VP-ellipsis analysis accommodates other null argument phenomena.',\n",

If the A-/A’-distinction is to be truly derived, then the characteristic that distinguishes the two classes of structures must emerge from a conspiracy of independently motivated principles and the distinction should explain why the contrasts between A-/A’-constructions are precisely those contrasts and not other contrasts. The key theoretical proposal that underlies my account is that an independently motivated alteration in the terms available to Merge results in a crucial difference between the two construction types. Once a wh-phrase DP moves, a conspiracy of factors insures that it is altered on the way to its landing site or else it will interfere with normal Case and agreement relations (as first proposed by Rezac, 2003). An optional instance of Merge, late attachment of a prepositional head to the moved DP, ‘insulates’ that DP from Case and agreement, but alters the relations it can have with other DPs, with wide consequences for what an insulated DP can antecede and or license. A revision of Chomsky’s (1995) ‘Extension’, the Peak Novelty Condition proposed here, is independently necessary to permit a variety of constructions, such as late attachment, tucking in, and head-adjunction, among others. Thus the possibility to Merge an insulator to a moved DP is just a consequence of what Merge operations are available. Although insulation is optional, it is limited by independently motivated interface requirements that determine the distribution of insulated constituents, thereby explaining what is crucially different about A- vs. A’-constructions and why A- and A’-structures differ in just the ways they do and not in other ways.',\n",

       "              'In English, some complex words can display exceptional accent preservation (EAP): they can preserve an accent from their base even when this would violate a general restriction against adjacent accents (e.g. retúrn → retùrnée). This paper analyses EAP both empirically and theoretically. The analysis of a set of 291 derivatives from Wells (2008) shows that this phenomenon can be partially attributed to the relative frequency of the base and its derivative and partially also to syllable structure, and that these two factors have a cumulative effect. It is also shown that the existence of a more deeply embedded base (e.g. colléct → colléctive → còllectívity ~ collèctívity) can increase the likelihood for a derivative to display EAP. A formal account of the phenomenon is proposed building on Collie’s (2007, 2008) “fake cycicity” analysis, using weighted constraints (Pater 2009, 2016) and Max-Ent-OT (Goldwater & Johnson 2003). Finally, a model of lexical access building on Hay’s (2001, 2003) model and integrating more deeply embedded bases is proposed.',\n",

       "              'The  sign  language  phenomenon  that  some  scholars  refer  to  as  ‘agreement’  has  triggered controversial discussions among sign language linguists. Crucially, it has been argued to display properties  that  are  at  odds  with  the  notion  of  agreement  in  spoken  languages.  A  thorough theoretical investigation of the phenomenon may thus add to our understanding of the nature and limits  of  agreement  in  natural  language.  We  argue  against  three  approaches:  (i)  previous  non-\\r\\nsyntactic  gesture-based  approaches,  (ii)  hybrid  accounts  combining  syntactic  and  thematic agreement  and (iii)  analyses  that treat  agreement  markers  as  clitics.  Instead,  we  show that  sign \\r\\nlanguage agreement is consistently syntactic agreement and that it can be accounted for by means of  mechanisms  that  have been  independently  proposed  for  spoken  language.  We  argue  that  the modality-independent syntactic account proposed in this paper is able to capture the distinction of verb types, the behavior of backwards verbs, and the use of the agreement auxiliary. However, we suggest  that  the  combination  of  mechanisms  is  modality-specific,  that  is,  agreement  in  sign language involves modality-independent ingredients, but uses a modality-specific recipe. It is the very nature of agreement in sign languages, its spatial and gestural properties, that motivates the distinction of verb types and the existence of backwards verbs, and which thus calls for an unusual combination of independently motivated mechanisms.

In Tlingit, certain negative gradable predicates are formed by negating a positive root and then applying an additional (unproductive) morphological operation: e.g. k’éi ‘good’, tlél ukʼé ‘not good’, tlél ushké ‘bad’. A variety of facts show that (i) the negation in forms like tlél ushké ‘bad’ is VP-external, clausal negation, and is not an incorporated negative prefix like un- in English, and (ii) the meaning of these forms is indeed that of a gradable negative predicate, and is not simply the propositional negation of the positive predicate (unlike tlél ukʼé ‘not good’). Under the proposed analysis, the additional morphological operation observed in these forms is the reflex of a special degree relativizer, one that is not found in English and must undergo movement to Spec-NegP. In addition, Tlingit differs from English and other languages in that degree operators – like POS and comparative operators – can be adjoined relatively high in the clause, above negation. In addition to capturing a variety of facts concerning these negative predicates, the proposed analysis has consequences for our understanding of more general issues surrounding gradable predicates, particularly so-called ‘Cross-Polar Nomalies’ (CPNs) (Büring 2007a,b; Heim 2008) and intervention effects in the movement of degree operators (Heim 2001). Regarding the former, I show that Tlingit exhibits CPNs directly parallel to those in English. However, due to idiosyncrasies of Tlingit morphosyntax, Büring’s (2007a,b) analysis of these phenomena has an advantage over Heim’s (2008) account.',\n",

Our view of the interface is constrained by substance-free generative phonological assumptions and by insights gained from psycholinguistic and phonetic models of speech production. To distinguish transduction of abstract phonological units into planned neuromuscular patterns from the biomechanics of speech production usually associated with physiological phonetics, we have termed this interface theory ‘Cognitive Phonetics’ (CP). The inner workings of CP are described in terms of Marr’s (1982/2010) tri-level approach, which we used to construct a linking hypothesis relating formal phonology to neurobiological activity. Potential neurobiological correlates supporting various parts of CP are presented. We also argue that CP augments the study of certain phonetic phenomena, most notably coarticulation, and suggest that some phenomena usually considered phonological (e.g., naturalness and gradience) receive better explanations within CP.',\n",

In this study, I evaluate this claim in light of Tuscan Italian. Using three phonological diagnostics, it will be possible to split the consonant clusters (CCs) of Tuscan into three types: Branching onset, Coda-Onset and Bogus clusters. Metrical lengthening and Gorgia Toscana filter out Branching onsets leaving behind Coda-Onset and Bogus clusters as remnant. Elsewhere, the process of Epenthesis (in non-standard dialects) filters out the Bogus clusters instead leaving Branching onsets and Coda-Onset clusters as remnant. Comparing the two sets of remnant allows for the extraction of the Coda-Onset set. Using a Sonority Differential analysis (Parker 2011), it becomes evident (process by process) that sonority is not the primary (or a preferable) mechanism in determining these sets. In seeking an alternative analysis, Gorgia Toscana will be presented in some detail along with its implications for sonority. Gorgia underapplies with Bogus clusters. I will provide a suggestive sketch for a competing representational solution based on Strict CV (in particular Lowenstamm 2003 and Brun-Trigud & Scheer 2010). Informed in part by interlude theory (Steriade 2008), it offers an alternative account for the lenition facts: compressible CCs (Branching onsets) are equivalent to a singleton stop, while non-compressible clusters (Coda-Onset and Bogus clusters) are equivalent to geminates. Unlike sonority based analyses, the phonological definition of the clusters offered here has a clear relationship with the phonological processes that occur to them.\\r\\n',\n",

I show how label affects the workings of narrow syntax by focusing on unusual agreement phenomena in Russian. Next I investigate the status of labeling within our mind by focusing on examples from temporal, visual and musical cognition. I argue that the purpose of labeling (in a broad sense) is establishment of asymmetry, which allows us to make perceptual/meaningful distinctions about the world and to make objects on which a cognitive faculty operates usable in other domains. It is in this sense that label is not only “conceptually necessary” but also empirically necessary for objects generated by narrow syntax, which have to be interpreted at the interfaces that relate language to the rest of the cognitive faculties.

The number marking on nouns in this construction is viewed as the principled interplay of the spell out of number features, their place, and that of numerals, in the syntactic structure of noun phrases, and their compositional semantics.

In the traditional naming pattern, Korean first names consist of a generation marker and a unique portion, and the order between these two elements alternates between generations. To derive vocative forms, the generation marker is truncated, and the suffixal [(j)a] is attached to the unique portion. We argue that MOP naturally predicts this type of truncation. As the generation marker is shared by all the members of the same generation, the generation marker is highly predictable and hence does not reduce uncertainty about the intended message. To achieve effective communication, predictable portions are deleted. To the extent that our analysis is on the right track, it implies that MOP is relevant not only to phonetic implementation patterns, but also to (morpho-)phonological patterns. It also provides support to MOP based on data from a non-Indo-European language. Finally, we aim to integrate insights of MOP with a more formal proposal like Optimality Theory, by relating the predictability of a contrast to the ranking of the faithfulness constraint that it protects, following the spirit of the P-map hypothesis.',\n",

       "              'This thesis is a study of the syntax of multi-verb constructions, in which a single clause contains more than one verbal element. Multi-verb constructions are of special interest in light of the hypothesis that clausal structure is headed by a verb. Implemented in terms of extended projections, this hypothesis states that clausal functional structure is the extended projection of a verb. A full understanding of multi-verbal constructions, in which there is no one-to-one verb–clause mapping, relies on refinements of the intimate relation between clause structure and the verbal category. Analyzing various types of multi-verb constructions in Ndebele, a Bantu language of Zimbabwe, I propose a theory multi-verbal syntax which makes explicit the ways in which a single extended projection may contain more than one verb. I propose a basic distinction within the verbal category into projecting verbs and non-projecting verbs. Projecting verbs have the ability to head a full clause and are what we typically think of as lexical verbs. Non-projecting verbs, on the other hand, are inherently unable to project full clausal structure. There are two types of non-projecting verbs in Ndebele. Aspectual auxiliaries are lexical items whose category feature has mixed properties: it has properties of both a lexical verb and some functional head in the clausal spine. The mixed properties are detected by different aspects of their syntax. The second type of non-projecting verb is the default auxiliary (be, in Ndebele), used in compound tenses. The default auxiliary is a verbal expletive, which becomes part of the derivation via last-resort selection. Any multi-verbal construction with more than one lexical (projecting) verb necessarily contains more than one extended projection. Additionally, the thesis is concerned with the role of two syntactic dependencies in the inflectional domain: agreement and selection. Both relations are involved in determining the morphological shape of multi-verb constructions by posing restrictions on the form, category and size of the main lexical verb. Depending on the light/auxiliary verb, it can be a participle (imperfective, past or future), have a subjunctive form (present or past), or be infinitival/clausal. It is argued that such cooccurrence patterns are largely predictable from clause structure and agreement. Selection is involved only in a small set of idiosyncratic cases of complement selection.',\n",

Reduced unconditionals in English therefore appear to be genuine cases of pseudosluicing (Merchant 1998).

This article provides new arguments for Herbert’s position, drawn from a large typological study of South American languages.

We tested the acceptability of wh-extraction from five island types: whether-, complex NP, subject, adjunct, and relative clause (RC) islands. We found clear evidence of subject and adjunct island effects on wh-extraction. We failed to find evidence that Norwegians accept wh-extraction out of complex NPs and RCs. Our participants judged wh-extraction from complex NPs and RCs to be just as unacceptable as subject and adjunct island violations. The pattern of effects in Norwegian paralleled island effects that recent experimental work has documented in other languages like English and Italian (Sprouse et al. 2012, Sprouse et al. 2016). Norwegian judgments consistently differed from prior findings for one island type: whether-islands. Our results reveal that Norwegians exhibit significant inter-individual variation in their sensitivity to whether-island effects, with many participants exhibiting no sensitivity to whether-island violations whatsoever.

Adopting this latter approach, we argue that inflectional paradigms are neither morphosyntactic primitives nor the result of competition. This claim is supported by data from two unrelated languages. For Hebrew, we demonstrate that a passive gap is not the result of competition with analytic paraphrases. For Latin, we show that a cyclic, syntax-based approach is superior to a theory that generates nonactive verbs in the lexicon and has them compete against each other.

       "              'As is well known, the control dependency in grammar is broadly distinguished into two broad classes: exhaustive (i → i) and non-exhaustive (i → i+(j)). The goal of this paper is to show that languages seem to allow another type of control in addition to these and to provide a formal account for how it may be derived in grammar. This new type of control is neither exhaustive nor strictly non-exhaustive, in the sense described above. Rather, it involves a mapping between an individual i and another individual f(i), where f is a discourse-contextually defined function denoting some sort of social group or class membership, and where i is not = f(i). We call this new type of control \"proxy control\", in analogy with instances of proxy anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Schladt 2000, Reuland and Winter 2009) which have also been argued to involve a relation of this nature. Proxy control is interesting not only because it extends the typology of possible control relations in grammar, but also because it raises interesting questions about the distribution of OC vs. NOC and the factors that condition the parametric choice between the two. Our primary data comes from German and Italian collected from native speakers in in-person grammaticality judgment tasks and online surveys. For speakers of the southern standard dialects of German (Bavarian-Swabian, Swabian, Bavarian, and Austrian) and the Grossetano dialect of Italian (spoken in parts of Tuscany), we present empirical diagnostics to show that proxy control instantiates a species of OC. For the rest of the native speakers of German and Italian tested, proxy control instantiates a choice of NOC. We focus primarily on proxy OC in this paper and propose that it involves a kind of “cyclic” control: the first cycle involves a i → f (i) control dependency into a bouletic modal complement; the second, an f(i) → f(i) exhaustive control dependency into a deontic modal clause. Proxy OC is the composite consisting of these put together. We present agreement evidence from floating quantifiers in Italian and Condition B obviation effects in German to argue that the i → f (i) relation is not established in syntax: rather, a simple i → i exhaustive control relation alone is syntactically encoded. This i on the controllee (PRO) is then semantically extended at LF to f(i) (following an adaption of the extension semantics for partial control in Pearson 2016) yielding i → f (i). Toward the end of the paper, we turn to a discussion of dialectal and crosslinguistic variation for proxy control, which revolves around whether proxy control is instantiated as a species of OC or NOC. We discuss the nature of the variation in detail and also propose the ways in which such variation could be theoretically understood and modelled within the analytic framework of our approach to proxy OC.',\n",

One direct consequence is that if both A- and A′-features trigger a movement operation in unison, it should show mixed A/A′-behavior. This prediction is borne out in Dinka, where C hosts both φ- and A′-features and triggers movement with both A- and A′-properties.\\r\\nIn this article, I extend this result to English. First, I show that the distribution of φ and A′ features in English is such that v, but not English C, is a potential composite movement trigger. This limited possibility for composite movement, I then argue, suggests a novel solution to the longstanding puzzle of English tough-movement (TM). TM famously shows mixed A/A′-behavior that has long posed a challenge in the context of the traditional A/A′-dichotomy – it is long-distance and can cross over c-commanding DPs, yet it targets a case position and triggers φ-Agreement – and moreover behaves as if Spec(CP) is an inaccessible landing site – it is fully acceptable across control infinitives, which lack a phasal CP (Wurmbrand 2014), but degraded past finite CPs, which do not. Treating TM as a successive cyclic composite movement operation from Spec(vP)-to-Spec(vP) solves these and several other novel and well-known puzzles of TM.',\n",

Apparent counterexamples, where conjuncts seem to differ with respect to morphological case marking, are claimed to be either due to a misanalysis of the underlying syntactic structure or due to superficial morphological processes that create the impression of a difference in case marking. Once we control for phenomena of this sort (namely &P-clitics, Suspended Affixation and Allomorphy), we find that case marking is always symmetric in nominal conjunction. This finding is in stark contrast to the phenomenon of phi-agreement which is known to exhibit asymmetry effects. Based on this observation, I show that the standard approach to case assignment according to which case arises only as a reflex of phi-agreement cannot account for this mismatch without stipulative assumptions. Under two more recent approaches to case marking, however, namely the Upward Agree approach as well as the Dependent Case Approach, the observed mismatch between case and agreement falls out as expected. Finally, I show that the generalization established in this paper can be used as a simple diagnostic to distinguish syntactic from morphological case marking alternations.\\r\\n',\n",

The account assumes that suppletive roots, despite appearances to the contrary, are not contextual allomorphs, but portmanteaus spelling out two distinct features, one belonging to the lexical root, and another one belonging to the comparative. The regular comparative affix then spells out an additional feature relating to the comparative domain. In other words, we show that the comparative (CMPR) head that enters into the morphological makeup of the comparative (Bobaljik 2012) is to be split up into two distinct heads, C1 and C2 (see also Caha 2016). We extend this idea to SPRL, which we show is likewise to be split up into S1 and S2, in order to account for suppletive ABC patterns. These four distinct heads receive empirical support from facts of the degree morphology in Czech and Latin. The new account of root suppletion allows a straightforward way of deriving the attested and unattested patterns of (root) suppletion in degree comparison. The analysis developed supports the hypothesis that the absence of AAB patterns in degree comparison is due to a constraint of a different nature altogether.',\n",

This paper makes two arguments: that a diverse range of phenomena exemplify irreducible parallelism; and that they have the same general structure. Our evidence comes primarily from the distribution of stress, lengthening, and epenthesis in Mohawk, and a reduplication-repair interaction in Maragoli. Our cases can be treated in OT, but challenge HS due to its gradualness requirement. These systems take on the following structure: to best satisfy constraints, the grammar applies one change followed by another, unless the result is ill-formed; in such a case, the grammar applies a different series of changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Soon to be superseded by a longer manuscript, which covers a broader range of cases and explores in greater depth their general structure.)',\n",

Concern over the less restricted nature of the new approach led some researchers to propose alternative analyses of these phenomena that did not require the unbounded reach of AGREE, in the hope that a more restrictive theory might yet be salvaged. In this paper I scrutinize some of the most widely cited and fully developed of these alternative proposals, applied to extensively studied spheres of data, and conclude that they are deeply, perhaps fatally, flawed.

       "              'This dissertation discusses the distribution of object pronouns, subject and object resumptive elements, and clausal determiners in Kwa (Niger-Congo) languages, particularly Gã and Akan. The empirical issues addressed are as follows. First,  some object pronouns are always overtly realised while others are always null. The aim was to provide a unified analysis of their distribution.  Second,  while Akan has been argued to have resumption for both subjects and objects in various A-bar constructions, only A-bar extracted object arguments yield an independent resumptive pronoun; a subject resumptive element is a bound form. Furthermore,  extracted local subject arguments always permit a default subject prefix in the extraction site. The aim was to provide a re-analysis of the empirical facts, to the effect that the subject case cannot be considered as a resumptive pronoun.  Third, it has been long observed that in Gã and several other Kwa languages, a determiner-like element shows up in complement clauses (CPs) from which A-bar extraction has taken place. It turns out that morphologically-similar functional elements are found in relative clauses and subject CPs, as well as adverbial clauses like conditional and time clauses when they occur to the left of a matrix clause. The aim was to account for the uniform behaviour of constructions which have this determiner-like element.\\r\\n In chapter  2, I argue that object pronouns that are always overtly realised, as in (a) those that precede an adverbial in (what looks like a) clause-final position, (b) when they occur as the object argument of a change of state predicate, (c) when they occur as the only argument of a depictive (secondary) predicate, and (d) when they are animate, are pronounced in a specifier position in the structure. For object pronouns that are null on the surface, however,  the proposed analysis suggests that their phonological contents are deleted in a complement position in the VP. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the predictions of the analysis are borne out in several other languages.\\r\\n I argue in chapter 3 that contrary to claims by previous authors,  Akan has no subject resumptive pronouns, and that what have been hitherto analysed as such can easily be accounted for as realisations of phi agreement on the  T(ense) head, which is realised on the verb. This is argued to result from a configuration in which a phi element stranded by an A-bar-marked element moves to spec, TP. This is the mechanism that is responsible for the cases of full phi agreement described above. On the other hand, when the A-bar-marked element moves to spec, TP, this results in lack of agreement, necessitating the insertion of a default marker.   The difference between local and embedded subject extraction is argued to be as a result of the lack of an A-bar projection in the embedded context, presumably to avoid the A-bar element from freezing clause-medially. I also demonstrate that the formal mechanism that derives the agreement affects in resumption constructions is also able to account for what looks like default agreement in non-A-bar constructions, a phenomenon whose data has largely gone unnoticed in previous work.\\r\\n Regarding clausal determiners, the analysis proposed in chapter 4 suggests that the  Gã data provide overt evidence for the claim in the literature that all CPs are dominated by a nominal projection. In this respect, the clausal determiner heads the nominal projection. Therefore, the analysis concludes that when a  CP occurs without a clausal determiner, it must have been deleted in the course of the derivation. Thus, a chunk of the chapter is devoted to showing how all the contexts in which the clausal determiner escapes the deletion mechanism converge, based on syntactic structure. ',\n",

Since Ouhalla 1993, this phenomenon has been known as anti-agreement. In this paper, we investigate cases of anti-agreement in which an A'extracted argument triggers anti-agreement not only on its locally φ-agreeing head, but also on a lower head that φ-agrees with a pronoun bound by the extracted argument (bound anti-agreement). Bound anti-agreement has received little attention in previous literature. Crucially, since the bound variable does not itself undergo movement, bound anti-agreement presents a challenge for analyses of anti-agreement that derive the effect through constraints on A'-movement. We argue instead that bound anti-agreement lends strong support to Baier's (2016) featural theory of anti-agreement, in which anti-agreement is the result of a φ-probe agreeing with an A’-operator bearing the feature [wh]. We moreover analyze bound anti-agreement in a parallel fashion to fake indexicals, thus unifying these two seemingly separate phenomena. Bound anti-agreement supports an analysis of fake indexicals in which a variable is 'born' underspecified, but acquires its features from its antecedent in the course of the derivation (e.g. Kratzer 2009). The features of the variable may be realized on the variable itself (as with fake indexicals) or as agreement with the variable (as seen in cases of bound anti-agreement).\",\n",

It argues that the derivation is driven by so-called derivational features, that is, structure-building features (Merge) and probe features (Agree) (Heck and Müller 2007 and Müller 2010; see also Chomsky 2000, 2001). Both types are essential in deriving case and agreement in the clausal domain and DP-internally. Feature values assigned by Merge take effect immediately whereas feature values assigned via Agree take effect at Spell-Out. This has the effect that Merge can overwrite Agree relations. \\r\\n\\r\\nI argue for a clear boundary between the syntactic and the morphological component regarding how case is assigned and agreement derived, placing Agree, Merge and case assignment in syntax whereas a translation of case assignment into morphological case and agreement takes place in the morphological component. Case morphology is the result of a three-step process: (i) A syntactic relationship with a functional head (e.g., Agree with Voice); (ii) a morphological translation of that relationship into a case feature (e.g., from syntactic STR to morphological ACC); and (iii) a morphological realization of that feature at Vocabulary Insertion. I argue that there are three types of syntactic case: structural, inherent and quirky case. Structural nominative case is either the result of structural case assignment or the realization of unassigned case. If a DP has not been assigned case by Spell-Out, its syntactic case is determined as STR. Structural and quirky case is often assigned by Voice via Agree but inherent case is assigned by Appl via Merge. \\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the dissertation studies the interaction of Voice, case and implicit arguments. It provides new analyses for various constructions in Icelandic where the dichotomy between active and passive breaks down. As I demonstrate, passive and active are labels for a collection of properties of VoiceP, where these properties may vary partially independently, yielding constructions that do not fit the traditional labels. I refine and improve our understanding of the nature of implicit arguments and how they interact with different Voice types. Following Landau’s (2010) distinction between Weak and Strong Implicit Arguments (WIA and SIA), I extend Legate’s (2014) analysis of the New Impersonal Construction to other constructions. I propose that WIAs are not always projected but when they are, they bear case.

The problem is that, without stipulating restrictions on which propositions are relevant, the theory overgenerates ignorance inferences across the board. We argue that the solution is to close relevance under belief (if φ is relevant, then it\\'s also relevant whether the speaker believes φ). This move has the effect that ignorance inferences, like scalar implicatures, can only be derived in grammar, via a covert belief operator of the sort proposed by Meyer (2013) and discussed further by Fox (2016). The maxim of quantity, we show, then no longer enriches the meaning of an utterance, per se, but rather acts as a filter on what can be relevant in an utterance context. In particular, certain alternatives (of certain utterances) are shown to be incapable of being relevant in any context where the maxim of quantity is active -- a property we dub obligatory irrelevance. We argue that obligatory irrelevance provides the key to understanding the contrast in ignorance inferences exhibited by \"at least\" vs. \"more than\". We also argue that translating our proposal into neo-Gricean terms, if at all possible, would yield a conceptually less appealing and empirically less adequate theory.',\n",

       "              '\\r\\nPhonological variation is common in many alternations, especially in processes where the target and the trigger of the alternation are in different words—external sandhi processes. Much previous work on external sandhi has addressed the morpho-syntactic locality conditions that restrict these cross-word processes, but they are also often sensitive to phonetic and usage factors like pauses, speech rate, lexical frequency, and speech style. What has not been explored in previous work is why these factors are consistently associated with external sandhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thesis pursues the hypothesis that patterns of external sandhi variation are shaped by online speech production planning constraints, which can mediate the effect of both grammatical and non-grammatical factors. I investigate the Production Planning Hypothesis (PPH) proposal that the narrow window of phonological encoding can block application of external sandhi processes—if the triggering context is not within the same planning window as the target of a process, it cannot apply. The size of the speech planning window is variable, and has been shown to be influenced by many of the factors associated with phonological variation. The predictions of the PPH are tested in case studies of three different external sandhi processes. These studies also contribute to a general understanding of the relationship between variability and syntactic, prosodic, and lexical factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first study investigates the effect of word boundaries, prosodic position, and phonetic pauses on variation of high vowel devoicing (HVD) in Tokyo Japanese. Statistical modeling of HVD patterns in a corpus of spontaneous speech suggests that these factors jointly affect HVD, and that position within a prosodic phrase modulates the effect of speech rate and lexical frequency on HVD. It is proposed that two distinct processes underlie HVD, one that is sensitive to the segmental content of the upcoming word (interconsonantal HVD), and another that is triggered by strong prosodic boundaries (phrase-final HVD). Under this view, part of the variation can be explained under the PPH as production planning effects on interconsonantal HVD.\\r\\nIn a second case study, two factors previously associated with external sandhi variation are tested directly: syntactic structure, and lexical frequency. Both of these factors have also been shown to affect speech planning and therefore, according to the PPH, should affect external sandhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a production experiment, we examine the effect of a clause boundary on realization of word-final coronal stops in North American English. Clause boundaries are found to have a gradient inhibitory effect on flapping, beyond the effect of associated final lengthening. The PPH explanation for this effect is that a clause boundary induces a delay while high-level planning of the next clause takes place, so segmental details of a potentially flap-triggering word will rarely be available. In contrast, a word that is within the same clause is much more like to be planned within the same window.\\r\\n\\r\\nLexical frequency can also affect the time course of speech planning. Higher lexical frequency is associated with faster retrieval, so the PPH predicts that the realization of a word-final coronal stop will be related to the frequency of the word that follows it. A higher frequency following word will be retrieved more quickly, and be more likely to trigger flapping. The relationship between lexical frequency and coronal stop realization is examined in a corpus of American English, and a positive correlation is found between frequency and flapping, as predicted.\\r\\nThe third case study extends testing of PPH predictions to a non-reductive external sandhi process: liaison in French. Frequency and also predictability are used as proxies for upcoming word availability. The PPH predicts that the correlations should be positive, just as for flapping, since both flapping and liaison rely on the knowledge that the upcoming word starts with a vowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamination of two syntactic contexts suggests that increased following word predictability, measured by both local (conditional probability) and global (lexical frequency), increase the likelihood of liaison application. Finding the same effect for the qualitatively distinct processes of flapping and liaison lends support to the PPH proposal that accessibility of the word containing the triggering information for sandhi constrains application of the process.\\r\\nThe PPH offers a unified account of variation in external sandhi related to both grammatical and non-grammatical factors. In addition, the PPH makes many new, testable predictions for future work: the size of the window for phonological encoding should be correlated with the application of external sandhi, with less sandhi applying when the window is more narrow.',\n",

       "              'Findings from the field of experimental linguistics have shown that a native speaker may judge a variant that is part of her grammar as unacceptable, but still use it productively in spontaneous speech. The process of eliciting acceptability judgments from speakers of non-standard languages is sometimes clouded by factors akin to prescriptive notions of grammatical correctness. It has been argued that standardization enhances the ability to make clear-cut judgments, while non-standardization may result to grammatical hybridity, often manifested in the form of functionally equivalent variants in the repertoire of a single speaker. Recognizing the importance of working with corpora of spontaneous speech, this work investigates patterns of variation in the spontaneous production of five neurotypical, adult speakers of a non-standard variety in terms of three variants, each targeting one level of linguistic analysis: syntax, morphology, and phonology. The results reveal the existence of functionally equivalent variants across speakers and levels of analysis. We first discuss these findings in relation to the notions of competing, mixed, and fused grammars, and then we flesh out the implications that different values of the same variant carry for parametric approaches to Universal Grammar. We observe that intraspeaker realizations of different values of the same variant within the same syntactic environment are incompatible with the ‘triggering-a-single-value’ approach of parametric models, but we argue that they are compatible with the concept of Universal Grammar itself. Since the analysis of these variants is ultimately a way of investigating the status of Universal Grammar primitives, we conclude that claims about the alleged unfalsifiability of (the contents of) Universal Grammar are unfounded.',\n",

I examine whether null arguments in such languages involve internal structure by testing extraction possibilities out of them on the basis of the hypothesis that the possibility of extraction indicates the presence of internal structure in anaphora sites. Based on novel data from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, and Turkish, I show that elliptic arguments exhibit a hitherto unnoticed pattern of extraction out of ellipsis sites, a pattern that does not follow from either Hankamer and Sag’s (1976) surface anaphora such as VP-ellipsis or deep anaphora such as do it anaphora. Specifically, I show that null arguments in the languages in question uniformly disallow overt extraction out of them, while they uniformly allow covert extraction (more precisely, extraction that does not affect word order). Having established the overt/covert extraction asymmetry out of null arguments under consideration, I show that the extraction pattern in question has several consequences for the PF-deletion versus LF-copying debate in the literature on ellipsis. Specifically, taking the possibility of overt extraction out of anaphora sites as an indication of the presence of internal structure in overt syntax and the possibility of covert extraction as an indication of the presence of internal structure in covert syntax/LF, I argue that the relevant extraction asymmetry out of null arguments in question is best analyzed under the LF-copy analysis, which provides ellipsis domains with internal structure only in covert syntax/LF so that only covert movement is possible out of the relevant domains. I argue that PF-deletion is also an available strategy and propose that the dichotomy between PF-deletion and LF-copying is related to the phasal status of ellipsis domains, building on Bošković’s (2014) phase-based analysis of ellipsis, where only phases and phasal complements can undergo ellipsis. In particular, I claim that ellipsis of phases, including argument ellipsis, is implemented by LF-copying and ellipsis of phasal complements is implemented by PF-deletion, which is shown to be a by-product of the phase theory. Finally, I show that the LF-copy analysis of elliptic arguments has consequences for the proper analysis of a number of phenomena, including wh-in-situ, control, and the timing of null operator movement.\\r\\n',\n",

Second, their sentential distribution is in part context-sensitive, thus based on the categories with which they combine. Third, their semantic contribution is “layered”, in the sense that it includes the meaning dimensions of both aspectual boundedness and specificity.

       "              'Whenever two otherwise similar grammatical elements display distinct properties and appear in distinct environments, we have in principle two analytic possibilities. One is to posit that they are indeed two underlying elements with inherently distinct properties, which then lead to them having different distributions (Inherent view). The other is to posit a single underlying element with a broad distribution, with the grammatical distinctions arising from the different contexts in which that element appears (Derived view). The goal of this paper is to provide novel theoretical and empirical evidence supporting a version of the Derived view for pro vs. PRO. In particular, we will argue that OC PRO and pro are just labels for different manifestations of what is underlyingly a single underspecified nominal pro-form, which we will call UPro. Included under this UPro will also be the various types of ‘non-obligatory control’ (NOC) PRO, including arbitrary pro (pro_arb). The interpretive and distributional distinctions lurking behind these labels will be seen to derive from how UPro interacts with its structural environment and language-specific rules of morpho-phonological realization. Specifically, OC PRO labels a rather specific interpretation that arises in embedding contexts where a syntactic OC relationship with an antecedent can be established. Different types of pro and NOC PRO, on the other hand, involve ‘control’ by (typically) silent representations of discourse-contextual elements in the clausal left periphery. Finally, pro_arb arguably involves the failure to establish a referential dependence, which we will formalize in terms of a failure to Agree in the sense of Preminger (2014). The crucial evidence that motivates the Derived approach proposed here will be adduced from the “Finiteness pro-drop Generalisation” from Sundaresan (2014): \"For (at least a non-trivial set of) pro-drop languages with subject-verb agreement, pro-drop is disallowed in the subject position of a prototypically non-finite clause.\"',\n",

In a recent reply to G&dV, Ott (2016) counters this specific argument, discards the more general integration analysis adopted by G&dV on conceptual grounds, and contends that an orphanage analysis of ARCs provides a more parsimonious explanation for the data that G&dV introduce.\\r\\n\\tIn this more elaborate rejoinder to Ott’s (2016) reply, we demonstrate that, while Ott presents some relevant data and provides welcome discussion, his specific counterargument to G&dV does not withstand scrutiny.

In particular we wish to stress that, if one given implementation of the integration analysis exhibits shortcomings, this does not logically imply that parentheticals must be orphans. Indeed, we will demonstrate that recent research on the ‘syntacticisation’ of speech acts engenders an integration analysis that does not exhibit the conceptual deficiency that Ott attributes to G&dV’s analysis.

One of them is the alternation between verbal agreement paradigms common in Algonquian languages: SIMPLE vs. COMPLEX agreement (traditionally Conjunct Order and Independent Order), and the other is the distribution of Verb Second (V2) in Germanic. The basic Algonquian pattern uses COMPLEX agreement (characterized by an agreement proclitic) as the default, with SIMPLE agreement (that lacks the proclitic) being restricted to a small “marked” set of clauses. We focus primarily on Arapaho (Plains Algonquian) as an outlier within its language family – it uses SIMPLE agreement as the default and COMPLEX agreement as the “marked” paradigm, comparing it to English and its “Residual V2” pattern of Aux-C inversion. We argue that the similarities between the two “residual” patterns are not coincidental and reveal a deeper parallelism: the distribution of V2 in Germanic and the SIMPLE/COMPLEX alternation in Algonquian stem from the same requirement of the verb to move to C only in some syntactic environments. The main difference is that in Algonquian V-C movement feeds the realization of additional C-related agreement. This allows us to extend Richards’s (2004) analysis of the agreement alternation in Wampanoag (Eastern Algonquian) to both the “basic Algonquian” and Arapaho patterns by treating the former as the Algonquian equivalent of “canonical V2” and the later as “Residual V2”.',\n",

We assume that the DOC has the format [ApplP Recipient [Appl’ Appl [VP  V  Theme]]]], where languages vary in the Case-assigning properties of Appl. In symmetrical languages Appl can assign Case to either Recipient or Theme. We propose that ApplP, not vP, is the lower, thematic phase in passives, as Appl is the highest functional thematic head introducing an argument, and that there is a single escape hatch from phases. In Theme passives, the Theme moves initially to the edge of ApplP, and subsequently to specTP. This blocks A-bar movement of the Recipient, which gets transferred along with the lower phase. In the Recipient passive, the Recipient moves to specTP before transfer of the lower phase, and the Theme argument remains accessible as it occupies the outer specifier of ApplP.

We argue that estar signals that the prejacent is boundedly true at the evaluation circumstance. The prejacent’s bounded truth at a circumstance i at a given context of use c depends on the existence of no-weaker alternative circumstances i′ accessible at c where the prejacent is false and on i being a maximal verifying circumstance at c. The analysis relies crucially on an explication of a strength ordering over alternative circumstances of evaluation. The assumption of this presuppositional component accounts for the distinct flavors of interpretation associated with estar with a range of predicates. ser is shown to be associated with its own inferences that derive from its status as the presuppositionally weaker, neutral member of the pair.',\n",

This explains the O>S word order but also the fact that straightforward extraction of all vP-internal material is banned. In the case of predominantly VSO languages, however, we propose that syntactic ergativity affects only the transitive subject: extraction of vP-internal adjuncts is unrestricted. This is because in S>O languages, the extraction restriction results from anti-locality, of the kind proposed by Erlewine (2016). We argue, moreover, that both kinds of syntactic ergativity in these languages ultimately arise due to defective intervention of the ergative subject in the Agree relation between INFL and the internal argument.

First, Role Shift used to report attitudes ('Attitude Role Shift') has a quotational component which does not follow from a simple context-shifting analysis. Second, Role Shift used to report other actions ('Action Role Shift') has a strong iconic component:  properties of signs that can be assigned to the reported situation (e.g. a happy face) must be so interpreted. We argue that both varieties of Role Shift should be analyzed as context shift, but with an important addition: the expressions that appear under Role Shift should be interpreted maximally iconically, i.e. so as to maximize the possibilities of projection between the signs used and the situation they make reference to (Role Shift is thus a 'super monster' not just in that it can shift the context outside of attitude reports, as was argued in Part I, but also in that it has an iconic and thus hyperintensional component).  This accounts both for the quotational character of Attitude Role Shift (in this case, maximal iconicity reduces to quotation), and for the fact that Action Role Shift has a strong iconic component. Finally, this analysis vindicates the view that some expressions may be simultaneously used and mentioned/demonstrated, as argued for instance in Recanati 2001.\",\n",

We take music cognition to be continuous with normal auditory cognition, and thus to deliver inferences about 'virtual sources' of the music (as in Bregman's Auditory Scene Analysis). As a result, sound parameters that trigger inferences about sound sources in normal auditory cognition produce related ones in music – as is the case when decreasing loudness signals the end of a piece because the source is gradually losing energy, or moving away. But what is special about music is that it also triggers inferences on the basis of the movement of virtual sources in tonal pitch space, which has points of stability (e.g., a tonic chord), points of instability (e.g., dissonant chords), and relations of attractions among them (e.g., a dissonant chord tends to be resolved). In this way, gradual movement towards a point of tonal stability, as in a cadence, may also serve to signal the end of a piece, but on the basis of tonal information. The challenge is thus to develop a framework that aggregates inferences from normal auditory cognition and tonal inferences. We sketch such a framework in a highly simplified case, by arguing that a source undergoing a musical movement m is true of an object undergoing a series of events e just in case there is a certain structure-preserving map between m and e. Thus we require that inferences triggered by loudness on the relative levels of energy or proximity among events should be preserved, and similarly for tonal inferences pertaining to the relative stability of events. This yields a 'bare bones' version of a music semantics, as well as a definition of 'musical truth'.  We then argue that this framework can help re-visit some aspects of musical syntax. Specifically, we take (Lerdahl & Jackendoff's, 1983) grouping structure to reflect the mereology ('partology') of events that are abstractly represented in the music – hence the importance of Gestalt principles of perception in defining musical groups.  Finally, we argue that this 'referentialist' approach to music semantics still has the potential to provide an account of diverse emotional effects in music.\",\n",

Our analysis is supported by a wide range of new facts on verb-echo answers, including the indefinite pro-drop restriction, the impossibility of voice-mismatches and adverb-inclusive interpretations. As our theory presupposes head movement \\r\\nas its central analytical premise, the results of this paper indicate that Japanese grammar is equipped with string-vacuous verb raising. We will also briefly explore some curious behaviors of verb raising in Japanese relating to the scope of negation under ellipsis and intervention effects. We will argue that this phenomenon is fundamentally different from its counterpart in European languages such as French in that the former is an optional operation in narrow syntax that only occurs if it yields new outcomes at PF and/or LF.  \\r\\n ',\n",

       "              'Semi-lexicality refers to lexical items which show both lexical and functional properties. Numerals, for instance, very often show some nominal or adjectival properties (lexical), despite having a quantificational function (functional). Such semi-lexical elements challenge theories of categories which assume discrete distinctions between nouns, verbs, and adjectives. If a numeral shares some, but not all properties with a noun, should we call it a noun instead of a numeral? This dissertation addresses such questions, and explores the concept of semi-lexicality. It focuses on phenomena in the nominal domain which largely involve idiosyncratic patterns of case and agreement. This thesis aims to identify how semi-lexicality arises in the syntax and what consequences it has for conceptualizations of categories. Semi-lexicality is explored via three case studies: Polish numerals, English quantificational nouns (lot, ton, bunch, number), and English kind-words (kind, type, sort). These case studies illustrate a variety of ways of being semi-lexical, and motivate an approach to semi-lexicality which decomposes basic notions of categories. By developing a precise theory of what it means to be lexical, functional, and semi-lexical, this thesis shows that it is possible to capture the idiosyncrasies of semi-lexicality in a predictable way.\\r\\n',\n",

We argue that \"precej\" and \"veliko\" are lexically synonymous, but their meanings are pragmatically strengthened under relevant conditions, which leads to subtle interpretative differences. Specifically, we extend Krifka’s (2007) analysis of double negatives and propose that \"veliko\" is assigned the stereotypical interpretation of a quantity degree word, whereas \"precej\" is identified with the non-stereotypical one and consequently relates to moderately big amounts. To support this claim, we report the results of an experiment involving a sentence-picture verification task, which highlight the similarities and contextually-determined differences in the use of both determiners. Our results suggest that the interpretation of \"precej\" is not consistent with relations in the upper part of the proportional scale and is dependent on whether or not it is in direct competition with \"veliko\" in the appropriate contexts.

We argue, however, that all feature valuation relations can be explained by a downward-probing Agree operation. Apparent instances of upward-probing feature-valuation are analyzed as anaphoric feature valuation, which is a com- posite operation consisting of movement of the relevant (unvalued, interpretable) features followed by probing of their c-command domain for valuation. A model of syntax that relies on the referential properties of phases is proposed to derive the behavior of anaphoric features from more fundamental syntactic properties, namely, that more rigid reference of a phase is derived by movement of phase-internal elements to the edge of that phase.',\n",

However it is in its infancy in classifier languages (ClLs), languages with a typically extensive inventory of ‘measure words’ that must be used in combining a numeral with any N. Building on Jiang and Hu 2010, I am going to document the existence of a classifier language with a lexical article, i.e. Yi, a Sino-Tibetan language, and provide a parametric analysis of such a language with respect to Mandarin. My main thesis is going to be roughly the following. There has been an ongoing debate on whether D is present in classifier languages and whether projecting D is always necessary for argument formation. The discovery of a classifier language with an overt lexical article may seem to tilt the balance in favor of the universal DP hypothesis. I will argue that the opposite is the case.',\n",

It is rather constructional, or built in syntax, distributing and receiving polysemous interpretations at various syntactic layers of the DP or CP, depending on quantity, perspective, evaluation, performativity, etc. Within this view, and apart from describing and identifying the various specifics of gender morphology, syntax, and semantics of some Arabic varieties, and investigating cross-linguistic parallels in other languages such as Romance, Berber, and Hebrew (see Fassi Fehri 2016 a &b), my broad empirical and theoretical interest in this article is to instantiate significant close interactions of the various grammatical categories found in the DP and Gender, and to account for how these interpenetrations follow naturally from appropriate hypotheses about articulation and design of grammatical architecture, framed in a form of what I will call functional universalism.

For this purpose, the empirical basis of the paper is a stronghold of moraic theory: stress in Palestinian Arabic, with its rich interplay of syllable structure and stress assignment, involving quantity sensitivity, a syllabically-determined stress shift and metrically-conditioned long vowel shortening. Showcasing the innovative grid-based notion of weight incorporation in Ulfsbjorninn (2014), the account provided recognizes only one unit relevant for meter: the nucleus. No appeal is made to moras, syllables, feet or extrametricality. Besides these principled advantages over the traditional moraic account, it is shown that metrical vowel shortening is much more simply explained in the present framework than in the moraic account, and can also explain final vowel shortening. The analysis is also brought to bear on Cairene Arabic, which in our analysis differs from Palestinian in a single parameter setting.  Finally, the paper also improves on previous analyses of meter in Strict CV, as for the first time in Strict CV metrics, a computational component is explicitly formalized. Given all of the advantages of the Strict CV account here presented, we submit that this framework, rather than the moraic alternative, should be pursued.',\n",

Several diagnostics are provided in order to help to a better understanding of the relevant empirical domains. A set of such diagnostics comes from uniformity considerations; i.e., the parallelism between elliptical and non-elliptical nominal phrases with respect to thematic assignment, matching effects and extraction. Other set comes from the specific conditions that distinguish empty nouns from nominal ellipses with respect to the need of an antecedent, identity effects, productivity and lexical meaning. The chapter also presents a discussion on the recoverability and licensing conditions that regulate the distribution of nominal ellipses. On the one hand, I show why syntactic identity is unavoidable for nominal ellipses. On the other hand, I try to demonstrate that there is no licensing by inflection in nominal ellipses of any sort. Instead, the morphological effects we observe are epiphenomena resulting from the way in which morphology resolves different stranded affix scenarios. Finally, I explore the domain of null arguments in null subject/object languages. It is shown on the basis of robust empirical evidence that the same distinction between empty nouns and ellipsis applies in this domain. The conclusion is that different sorts of nominal ellipses within and across languages ultimately boil down to the deep and surface anaphora distinction, on the one hand, and to the size of the constituent affected in each case, on the other.',\n",

       "              'Abstract. This paper is a case study of the imperative clause type and its relation to other clause types in Swedish and German in a modular framework. We will argue that there are three independent clause types, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive clause type, the differences between them derived from a morphologically founded distinction between three verbal paradigms, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive one. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe will further show how the three basic clause types are built up by three autonomous and interdependent modular systems, the morpho-syntactic, the semantic and the speech act system. Whereas the morpho-syntactic system operates with valued and unvalued features of various kinds, like [finite] and [φ], the semantic system supplies modal operators, that will provide the clause type with a clause type meaning. The speech act system will turn the clause type with its clause type meaning into a speech act, being the act the speaker performs, when uttering a clause. Not until the clause is accepted as a proper speech act at the speech act interface, will it become speech.\\r\\n\\tLike in Platzack & Rosengren (1998), we also once more claim, that the imperative clause type lacks TP, which in turn prevents it from getting a subject and embed. \\r\\n\\tBecause of its non-finite, i.e. imperative head, the imperative clause will be a clause type in the system of clause types right from the morphological beginning. It differs substantially in its syntactic structure from the finite clause as well as from the infinitive clause, being a clause type with a head with only a 2nd person inflection. This difference results in a slim structure, univocal meaning and a restricted area of application, the speaker uttering it in order to make or allow the addressee to act according to a norm. It can hence only be used to talk TO the addressee, not ABOUT him.\\r\\n',\n",

In the first two experiments, we show that children display a developmental discontinuity in their ability to use a noun's syntactic environment as a cue to its meaning. We argue that this pattern arises from children's reliance on their knowledge of verbs' subcategorization frame frequencies to guide parsing, coupled with an inability to revise incremental parsing decisions. We show that this analysis is consistent with the syntactic distributions in child-directed speech. In the third experiment, we show that the discontinuity arises from predictions based on verbs' subcategorization frame frequencies.\",\n",

The minimally different options allowed by the grammars of the ItaloRomance varieties considered are syntactically driven by the same mechanisms at work in Standard Italian complex PPs, i. e., small Ps are selected according to: (i) the interrelated movement/merge of PLACE to the edge of DPPlace and of AxParts in PPdir/PPstat, and (ii) the pronominal vs. nominal nature of the Ground. The microcomparative perspective adopted sheds some light into the possession relation between the Ground and PLACE, and ultimately into the nature of PLACE itself: when PLACE and AxParts remain in situ an external possession relation yields, and the DP Ground is marked for genitive, while, if PLACE is moved/merged to the edge of DPPlace and AxPart is moved/merged in PPdir/stat, the Ground appears in a Construct State-like configuration with it. In addition, such configurations still emerge with pronominal Grounds, yet in a different marking, i. e. genitive, given the restrictor-less internal structure of pronouns.  All this entails that movement of AxParts, movement of PLACE and the internal structure of Ground are intimately related, and PLACE should be thought of as a sort of relational noun, as microcomparative data from Southern Italian varieties show that pronominal Grounds take the same possession marking of pronominal possessors of relational nouns such as kinship terms and/or body parts.

       "              \"We argue that some properties of sign language grammar have counterparts in non-signers' intuitions about gestures, including ones that are probably very uncommon. Thus despite the intrinsic limitations of gestures compared to full-fledged sign languages, they might access some of the same rules. While gesture research often focuses on co-speech gestures, which co-occur with spoken words, we focus instead on pro-speech gestures, which fully replace spoken words and thus often make a full-fledged semantic contribution, like signs. We argue that gestural loci can emulate several properties of sign language loci (= positions in signing space that realize discourse referents): there can be an arbitrary number of loci, with a distinction between speaker-, addressee- and third person-denoting loci. Gestural loci may be free or bound, and they may be used to realize 'donkey' anaphora, including with antecedents under negation. Some gestural verbs include loci in their realization, and for this reason they resemble some 'agreement verbs' found in sign language (Schlenker and Chemla, to appear). As in sign language, gestural loci can have rich iconic uses, with high loci used for tall individuals, and with the possibility of co-opting a location-denoting locus to refer to an individual found at that location ('Locative Shift'). Turning to plurality, we argue that repetition-based gestural nouns replicate some properties of repetition-based plurals in ASL (Schlenker and Lamberton 2017): unpunctuated repetitions provide vague information about quantities, punctuated repetitions are often semantically precise, and rich iconic information can be provided in both cases depending on the arrangement of the repetitions; we discuss some possible extensions to continuous repetitions found with some mass terms. We further suggest that gestural verbs can give rise to repetition-based pluractional readings, as their sign language counterparts (Kuhn 2015). Following Strickland et al. 2015, we further argue that a distinction between telic and atelic sign language verbs, involving the existence of sharp boundaries, can be replicated with gestural verbs. Turning to attitude and action reports, we briefly ask (following Lillo-Martin 2012) whether 'Role Shift', which serves to adopt another agent's perspective in sign language, has gestural counterparts. Finally, we suggest that some means of focus realization in sign language can be used with pro-speech gestures and can affect truth conditions.\\r\\n\",\n",

We argue that the theoretical disagreement has an empirical underpinning. Roots may have syntactic features but this structural property interacts with derivational timing: if a root does not have any active syntactic features, then it must be Late Inserted. In contrast, roots with active syntac- tic features must be inserted early in order for those features to be available to syntactic computation.

One particularly influential account claims that argument ellipsis is possible if and only if the argument is not φ-agreed with — the Anti-Agreement Hypothesis (Saito 2007, Şener and Takahashi 2010). Otaki, Sugisaki, Yusa, and Koizumi (2013) show that null subjects and objects in Kaqchikel are not interpreted as full noun phrases, and therefore not the result of argument ellipsis.

Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analysis of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reigned in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but obeying the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.',\n",

We conduct both a meta-analysis of experimental studies capturing the age of acquisition for the passive use of English verbs and a corpus analysis of English children’s input. We find no relationship at all between the demonstrated age of acquisition (AoA) and input frequency, whether we examine frequency of the individual verb in the passive or frequency of the individual verb in any form. However, there is a striking correlation between the lexical semantic profile of verbs and the AoA for their passive use by English-speaking children. Our findings suggest lexical semantics are a key variable impacting children’s performance on the English passive.

This alternation has been known as a case epenthesis that challenges the existing theories of phonological markedness (Rice, 2008; Morley, 2015; Vaux & Samuels, 2015). The analysis of this alternation has also been debated (de Lacy, 2006; de Lacy & Kingston, 2013). This paper presents new fieldwork and experimental evidence showing that the reported epenthesis pattern fails to be generalized to new environments. The results go against the phonological insertion account of the alternation, and instead support the analysis of Buriat dorsal-zero alternation in terms of floating features, present only on the relevant native affixes.

In this paper we demonstrate that greater insights for a number of phenomena are achieved when analyzed with CV syllabification and onset consonants that are moraic, a possibility independently proposed for a wide range of languages by Topintzi (2010). Previous analyses were obliged to posit an underlying fleeting initial schwa for surface forms beginning with CV at the left edge; we demonstrate that once the full range of phenomena are considered, no such schwa is desirable, and that these words are underlyingly CV-initial. We review a range of prosodic morphology and external evidence from phonetic studies, acquisition, and musicology that points towards a CV syllabification in Arrernte and provide an analysis for the allomorphy, stress assignment, reduplication, and the transpositional language game ‘Rabbit Talk’ in terms of reference to moraic structure.

In a range of environments, it has been shown that pronouns appear to mark a position in a movement chain (e.g. Zaenen et al. 1981; Koopman 1982, 1984; Sells 1984; Engdahl 1985; Pesetsky 1998; Kandybowicz 2007; Holmberg and Nikanne 2008; Harizanov 2014; Sichel 2014). I presents a novel instance of this from the Nilotic language Dinka, in which copies left by successive-cyclic movement through the edge of the vP are spelled out as pronouns. I develop an approach to these facts that forces DP copies to undergo partial deletion in the context of multiple copy spell-out, under the view that prnouns represent DPs with an absent or elided NP complement (Postal 1969; Elbourne 2001, 2005). Evidence for this approach comes from the observation that there are a variety of ways in which copied pronouns differ from ‘trueborn’ pronouns. Specifically, as I show for Dinka and a range of other patterns, copied pronouns may be imperfect copies, and display both featural mismatches and gaps (patterns in which only a subset of possible DPs are doubled by a pronoun). I show that both of these patterns can be made to follow from the way partial deletion applies.',\n",

       "              \"Head movement and its status as a type of movement that is available in the syntactic component of the grammar has been under discussion in the literature in recent years. This discussion sprang up in part as a result of head movement's apparent lack of semantic effects. Some researchers have attempted to place head movement outside of the domain of syntax. More recently, evidence of semantic effects of head movement has led others to reconsider such a move. In this dissertation, I provide evidence for head movement as a movement that must be available in the syntax. I show that the phenomenon of negative auxiliary inversion provides evidence for the semantic effect of head movement. Negative auxiliary inversion is a phenomenon present in some varieties of English spoken in North America. This study focuses on a particular variety of English, West Texas English, and is informed by the larger theoretical background at the syntax-semantics interface. The theoretical issues that are highly relevant are negation, subject restrictions of certain types of constructions, scope, and principles of scope economy. The movement that derives constructions which exhibit negative auxiliary inversion is sensitive to principles of scope economy and movement which is semantically vacuous is disallowed. The types of subjects that are possible in negative auxiliary inversion behave uniformly in their scopal interaction with negation. This discovery furthers our understanding of why subject restrictions arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the theoretical goals, this dissertation expands the empirical domain concerning microsyntactic variation in English. Although there are many apparent differences among varieties of English, very little theoretical work has been done on varieties other than Standard English. In this dissertation, I consider the varieties of English which allow the phenomenon and propose that the availability of negative auxiliary inversion is correlated with the availability of a higher negative projection in a variety's hierarchy of projections as well as the availability of negative concord. Additionally, I extend the analysis to account for transitive expletive constructions, another phenomenon which is present in some varieties which exhibit negative auxiliary inversion. The analysis is also extended to account for\\xa0Not-initial constructions, a phenomenon available to speakers of many varieties of English. I propose such constructions to be derived by movement, though the movement I propose it to involve is phrasal rather than head movement. This distinction allows me to account for cross-linguistic variation because not all varieties which exhibit\\xa0Not-initial constructions also exhibit negative auxiliary inversion constructions.\\r\\n\",\n",

They further argue that this implication can be used to diagnose the absence of X-movement in a language (i.e. if it has XP-ellipsis but lacks the X-stranding pattern). In this reply, I show that this diagnostic is flawed: a language can have the relevant ingredients and yet lack the X-stranding pattern that the authors predict to be present, as in Mainland Scandinavian, which has verb-second but lacks verb-stranding VP-ellipsis. I argue that such exceptions are principled: the X-stranding pattern arises only if the operations responsible for these phenomena are timed such that the trigger for X-movement out of XP is merged earlier than, or at the same time as, the trigger for XP-ellipsis.

I begin by introducing the puzzle posed by -men in Mandarin Chinese (henceforth Chinese), a suffix that has been widely analysed as a collective marker but demonstrates various features of a plural marker. I argue that neither analysis is satisfactory given the interaction of -men and dou, the latter of which can be analysed as the lexical representation of the Matching Function (Rothstein, 1995; henceforth the M-Function). Crucially, the collective analysis of -men fails to explain why it can co-occur with dou, which requires access to individual atoms, while the plural analysis of -men fails to predict many of its distributions and interpretations.\\r\\nIn light of these puzzles, I observe that when there is no overt universal quantifier in the sentence, nominals with -men turn out to be ambiguous between a strong and a weak reading, but they must receive a definite interpretation and have a “significant subpart” requirement, analogous to the semantic denotation of most of the X. This motivates the GQT treatment of - men which assumes covert quantification in its semantic representation. Moreover, the two readings of -men disambiguate in the presence of dou, with only the strong reading left, which further suggests the existence of a covert universal quantifier in -men, given that dou as the M-Function seeks a universal quantifier in the semantic composition (Pan, 2005; Zhang, 2007). To this end, I offer an alternative analysis in GQT terms that compares nominals with -men to most of the X, and further argue against the view that dou itself is a universal quantifier by addressing several persisting problems from previous accounts.',\n",

Secondly, when both topics are derived via movement, their dependency relations with the corresponding gaps in the comment clause must be ‘nested’. This can be accounted for by the Path Containment Constraint proposed by Pesetsky (1982), which requires the paths of movement to be in a containment relation. These findings challenge the view that Chinese topics are merely constrained via a semantic “aboutness” relation with the comment clause (cf. Xu & Langendoen, 1985), suggesting that topicalisation in Mandarin Chinese is subject to syntactic constraints.',\n",

Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that more than one structural element can be the source of the valued features, and that the struc- turally higher element tends to be responsible for the semantically informed value (for instance, √ and n in Kramer 2009, see Pesetsky 2013 and Landau 2016 for related configurational analyses). Yet it is far from clear what it means for fea- tures to be valued from the ‘context,’ and why the structural height of functional heads should make a difference with respect to whether or not a syntactic feature is going to be semantically interpreted.\\r\\nThis paper brings into the debate new data from Standard Italian and uses it to argue for a novel treatment of semantically interpretable φ-features, specifically gender. The Standard Italian nominal system morphologically marks two distinct genders, three distinct nominal classes (idiosyncratic nominal endings), and two numbers, a combination which lends itself to a theoretical investigation of com- plex gender interactions. Crucially, Italian nominal inflection also distinguishes between grammatical, i.e., idiosyncratic, and natural, i.e., context-dependent, gender. The main empirical focus of the paper is on names of professions that exhibit morpho-syntactically varied behavior: for some speakers, the root chirurg- ‘sur- geon’ can denote a female even if it is grammatically masculine (il chirurgo ‘the.M surgeon’1), while other speakers prefer a derived form with a distinct morpholog- ical feminine marker, be it a feminine determiner, or a combination of a feminine determiner and a feminine ending on the noun (la chirurgo ‘the.F surgeon’ vs la chirurg-a ‘the.F surgeon-F). Some nouns, such as avvocato ‘lawyer,’ have the same range of the formal variation, even though there is a designated feminine de- rived noun (avvocatessa ‘female lawyer’).

       "              \"Simpson and Wu (2002) analyze Chinese shi-de constructions and propose a\\r\\nnew type of grammaticalization in the Minimalist framework called 'lateral' grammaticalization (LG). It is compared with Roberts and Roussou (R&R) (2003) and van Gelderen's (2004, 2011) Minimalist analyses of grammaticalization (henceforth 'standard' grammaticalization (SG)) and\\r\\nwhile both display 'structural simplification', as defined by R&R (2003:198-201) and van Gelderen (2011:13-21), LG does not display 'upward feature analysis', which is a diagnostic trait of SG (R&R (2003:200)). Rather, there is 'lateral feature analysis' where one functional category (e.g. D) is re-analysed as another (e.g. T) (S&W (2002:201-202)).Furthermore, while examples of SG regularly display semantic and morphophonological weakening (R&R (2003:218-229)), those of LG do not, which seems to suggest that 'upward feature analysis', not 'lateral feature analysis', is the cause behind weakening in grammaticalization. Bybee (2003, 2011) proposes that frequency is the main driving force behind weakening in grammaticalization, since as the grammaticalizing element undergoes weakening in semantics, it becomes compatible with a wider range of complements and hence rises in frequency which causes it to become automatised and lose morphophonological substance. There is therefore a causal relationship between semantic and morphophonological weakening ('parallel reduction hypothesis'/'co-evolution of meaning and substance' (Bybee et al (1994:17-21)). In my comparison between the Romance future (Latin infinitive + habere) (SG) and the Chinese copula shi (LG), it is discovered that 'upward feature analysis' in SG does indeed give rise to 'context expansion', namely a widening in the range of complementation (cf Bybee (2003)), which leads to rise in frequency and morphophonological weakening, while 'lateral feature analysis' in LG crucially leads to 'context reduction' which lowers the frequency of the grammaticalizing element and hence pre-empts its morphophonological weakening. Cross-linguistic patterns of weakening are examined and there seems to be a correlation between frequency effects in syntactic change and the rate of morphophonological weakening in functional elements. This is significant, since it is widely assumed that functional elements are necessarily weak (cf Selkirk (1984:335-337)) when the evidence from a formal analysis of grammaticalization suggests that the empirical properties of functional elements, namely their differential rates of weakening, can (and should) be derived from their genesis, namely grammaticalization (SG/LG). This opens up new research questions which are left for future investigations.\",\n",

Existing proposals derive V1 order in Mayan by base-generating the subject in a vP-internal right-side specifier (Aissen 1992) or by XP-fronting a predicate to a high left-side specifier position (Coon 2010). We review problems with previous accounts and argue that V1 is consistently derived by head movement of the verb to a position above the subject and below Infl0. This proposal accounts for uniformity in verb-stem formation across the family and provides a natural account of VSO orders. Next, we turn to VOS-VSO alternating languages, where a variety of factors have been reported to determine postverbal argument order, including specificity, definiteness, phonological weight, discourse prominence, and argument animacy (see e.g. England 1991). After an in-depth examination of these factors, we suggest that there are three distinct and independently motivated paths to VOS order in the Mayan family. First, based on prosodic evidence from Ch’ol, we argue that VOS may be derived by postsyntactic reordering of NP objects (Clemens 2014). In addition, VOS may arise through right-side subject topicalization (Can Pixabaj 2004; Curiel 2007) or the shifting of heavy subjects towards the periphery of the clause (Larsen 1988). This account both provides better empirical coverage internal to Ch’ol, and makes testable predictions in the domains of word order and prosodic constituency for other Mayan languages.',\n",

A number of proposals are made for Yoruba pre-history based on the method of internal reconstruction. Using generative syntax to describe the diachronic data from Yoruba leads to a number of issues that concern some proposals in the theory. Some diachronic data are found to support Rizzi’s (1997) left periphery proposal. But a question that becomes pertinent from some other data concerns what the hierarchy is between the perfective aspect and the imperfective aspect.

While each event is in some sense a singular unique occurrence, we generally talk about them as happening in a certain way with particular consequences, carrying on or ending after some amount of time, and involving different participants who bear particular relationships to the event. These conceptually general and grammatically relevant properties of events are captured in theories of event structure. The goal of such theories is to explain the patterns in meaning that arise from the structural aspects of language. Event structures do this by decomposing an individual event into a set of subevents which stand in particular relationships to one another. These component subevents and their relationships are often encoded in independently articulated linguistic constituents that are scattered throughout a sentence. As a result, these components must be recovered and put back together for a comprehender to properly understand the event that a sentence denotes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis chapter examines how some of the grammatically-determined interpretations arising from event structure unfold in real time, with a focus on sentence processing.

First, they can give rise to so-called non-maximal readings, in the sense that they ‘allow for exceptions’ ('Mary read the books on the reading list', in some contexts, can be judged true even if Mary didn’t read all the books on the reading list). Second, while they tend to have a quasi-universal quantificational force in affirmative sentences (‘quasi-universal’ rather than simply ‘universal’ due to the possibility of exceptions we have just mentioned), they tend to be interpreted existentially in the scope of negation (a property often referred to as homogeneity, cf. Löbner 2000). Building on previous works (in particular Krifka 1996 and Malamud 2012), we offer a theory in which sentences containing plural definite expressions trigger a family of possible interpretations, and where general principles of language use account for their interpretation in various contexts and syntactic environments. Our theory solves a number of problems that these previous works encounter, and has broader empirical coverage in that it offers a precise analysis for sentences that display complex interactions between plural definites, quantifiers and bound variables, as well as for cases involving non-distributive predicates.

The classic approach to numerical interpretation, pioneered by Horn (1972), contends that the basic, literal meaning of | is ‘at least three’ (a one-sided meaning), and that the upper bound it typically implies arises by way of scalar implicature. More recent approaches argue that the literal meaning of | is ‘exactly three’ (a two-sided meaning), implemented in one of a variety of ways (e.g. Geurts 2006; Breheny 2008; Kennedy 2015). With a few exceptions, the primary data set has, up to now, consisted of simple existential sentences with distributive predicates, as well as modal sentences. The goal of this article is to reassess these two basic approaches to numerals (the ‘at least’ approach and a representative family of ‘exactly’ approaches) in light of a broader range of data that includes existential sentences with collective predicates, such as | (cf. Link 1987, 1991). I show that a brand new puzzle emerges: on the one hand, (a version of) the classic account gets the collective facts exactly right, but it fails to predict a previously unnoticed asymmetry in the distribution of two-sided readings of numerical indefinites embedded under a downward-entailing operator; on the other hand, (a version of) the ‘exactly’ approach beautifully predicts the embedding facts, but overgenerates in the collective domain. I conclude by offering some speculation as to how the puzzle might be resolved in favor of the classic account.',\n",

I show first that taking into consideration cues to the contrasts between nasal-stop sequences and their component parts (nasals and stops) allows us to accurately predict generalizations regarding the distribution of phonemic nasal-stop sequences (i.e. those that are phonemically contrastive with other segment types). Following this I show that taking into consideration cues to the contrast between oral and nasal vowels allows us to accurately predict generalizations regarding the distribution of allophonic nasal-stop sequences (i.e. those not phonemically contrastive with other segment types), as well as generalizations regarding the distribution of phonemic nasal-stop sequences in the context of phonemically nasal and allophonically nasalized vowels. Broadly, the results presented here contribute to a larger body of evidence that constraints on contrast are a necessary component of the synchronic phonological grammar (following e.g. Lindblom 1986; Flemming 2002, 2008; Padgett 2009).',\n",

Yet this morphological marking also appears on anticausative verbs, which have different syntactic and semantic properties. I provide an analysis of reflexivity in Hebrew which does not make reference to dedicated reflexive morphosyntax. By combining independently needed functional heads, the proposal explains what in the syntax underlies this morphology and how different kinds of verbs end up with identical morphophonological properties. To this end, I consider the lexical semantics of individual lexical roots as well as the syntactic configurations in which roots and arguments are embedded.

       "              'This paper inquires into two issues of Hungarian PPs. Firstly, when Hungarian pronouns bear an oblique case, the case marker must be followed by possessive agreement. Secondly, this pronoun-case-agreement order contrasts with the order found in garden variety possessive structures: ordinary possessive DPs feature the order noun-agreement-case. The goal of this paper is to offer an account of these puzzling phenomena. I argue that a PP structure in which PPs are projected from a silent place noun and the Ground is merged as the possessor of place (Terzi, 2005, 2008, 2010; Botwinik-Rotem, 2008; Botwinik-Rotem and Terzi, 2008; Pantcheva, 2008; Cinque, 2010a; Noonan, 2010, and Nchare and Terzi, 2014) allows an elightening analysis of the appearance and position of the possessive agreement in PPs. I also discuss how certain surface differences between PPs and ordinary possessive constructions can be accounted for while maintaining the possessive analysis of PPs. By showing that a PP structure with a possessive core yields a natural account of the intricate Hungarian data, the paper strengthens the case for a possessive-based approach to PPs in Universal Grammar.',\n",

These classes of predicates describe events that can systematically be ``split'' between  members of the subject, giving rise to a nondistributive understanding.

Frederick Klaeber defines Old English motan as “may, have opportunity, be allowed”, all of which are quite different from the modern “must”. To explain the patterns of usage of motan in ninth-century Old English, Igor Yanovich convincingly proposes that the verb really had only one sense somewhere between “may” and “must”, and that its range of translations arises from the fact that this meaning is hard to express in modern English. Yanovich’s analysis, however, was limited to the ninth-century corpus of Alfredian texts, so he did not discuss whether the semantics of the verb, which had already mutated dramatically by Chaucer, remained the same in other Old English works. Beowulf is a good Old English text in which to examine the usage of motan for several reasons. Firstly, it is quite long, so there are many occurrences of what is a remarkably infrequent modal verb. In addition, it has several unclear passages containing motan, so any insight about the verb’s general meaning in the language of the poem could help explain these sections. Finally, the dating of  Beowulf  is hotly contested. Thus, placing the poem’s use of motan within a timeline of development could offer clues about when the poem was composed. After examining many occurrences of motan within  Beowulf , it is clear that the usage of motan fits the schema observed by Yanovich in Alfredian Old English. Moreover, Yanovich’s semantics for motan offer insight about how we should interpret several of the notoriously unclear passages in  Beowulf.',\n",

A novel method of coding and analyzing such data is developed, using a notion of ‘possible harmonic change’ derived from the corpus and logit mixed-effects regression models describing the difference between actually occurring harmonic changes and possible but non-occurring ones in terms of various sets of theoretical constructs. Models using different sets of constructs are compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion, which assesses the accuracy and complexity of each model. The principal results are that: (1) transitional probabilities are better modeled using root-motion and chord-frequency information than they are using pairs of individual chords; (2) transitional probabilities are better described using a mixture model intermediate in complexity between a bigram and full trigram model; and (3) the difference between occurring and non-occurring chords is more efficiently modeled with a hierarchical, recursive context-free grammar than it is as a Markov chain. The results have implications for theories of harmony, composition, and cognition more generally.\\r\\n',\n",

       "              \"Attributive adjectives have a number of properties that distinguish them from predicative adjectives and other modifiers of the noun. For example, attributives are subject to ordering restrictions that do not apply to other types of nominal modifier, and they exhibit scope interactions unlike predicatives or relative clauses. This thesis argues that these properties are best captured by an analysis in which all attributives share the same relationship with the noun and discusses the ways in which our understanding of a number of phenomena at the edges of attribution must change.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne influential theory of adjective ordering restrictions (discussed in Larson 2000a and Cinque 2010, among others) holds that violations of the ordering hierarchy that applies to many attributive adjectives are due to the existence of modifiers that superficially look like attributives but are in fact derived from reduced relative clauses. These derived attributives are merged higher than underived attributives and are unordered with respect to each other. I show that the offending adjectives do not behave syntactically like true relative clauses, whether full or reduced. In addition, while all attributive semantics is asymmetric, true relatives involve symmetric modification. This single-source approach entails a rethinking of some of the effects commonly understood to result from attribution. I will address two such effects, which could be taken as evidence in favour of a derived attributive approach to attribution, and show that they are best analyzed using a homogeneous approach to attribution. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn languages where the noun follows its modifiers, the ordering of AP and PP modifiers is free and their scope varies with c-command. In noun-initial languages their order is fixed, with the AP preceding other modifiers, and their scope is ambiguous. This pattern could be taken as evidence for a second source of adnominal modification, if the high position of the AP in noun-final languages is a reduced relative clause. However, I show that both the ordering and scope effects are due to a novel constraint restricting the linear order of attributive and other modifiers. The ordering patterns of AP and PP modifiers are therefore not evidence for the existence of derived attributives.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne piece of evidence for the dual-source theory of attribution is that some adjectives have unexpectedly rigid requirements for adjacency and nonintersectivity (for example, in the phrase 'hard worker'). I demonstrate that  cases like these are not true attribution but are instead a type of bracketing paradox. I argue that these bracketing paradoxes are derived by movement at LF. This movement (and indeed all movement) is restricted in the type of information that must be retained before and after the operation takes place, but is otherwise free. Therefore, these examples do not provide evidence for two different types of attributive modifier. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed analysis of attribution allows for a simplification of adjectival modification, as it does not require a distinction between derived and underived attributive adjectives. The analysis presented in this thesis entails a novel categorization of certain adjectival phenomena, but readily accounts for the empirical intricacies of attribution.  \",\n",

I also address the issue of whether work in generative syntax itself, that suggests that the content of functional categories  are co-opted from other systems of thought, threatens the autonomy thesis, and argue that it does not, providing an account of how functional categories are ordered (Extended Projection) that relies on the idea of maximizing the computational simplicity of the syntax-semantics interface.

Specifically, we will argue that, contrary to what is standardly assumed, the factors conditioning the EPP are actually not syntactic, but phonological, as has also been proposed by others in the literature. Nonetheless, the operations that it seems to trigger clearly are syntactic. This sheds light on why the EPP has been so difficult to get a handle on, but it also presents a conundrum, as it seems to suggest that aspects of the syntactic derivation depend on phonological information. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the  broadly Minimalist framework we adopt here, this would be clearly countercyclic. In the standard Y-model and its descendants, the output of the (narrow) syntactic derivation feeds into the interpretive components of PF and LF, thus while syntactic information feeds into PF, phonological information is not available to the syntax. More recent phase-based and multiple Spell-out models introduce a certain amount of feedback, such that syntactic cycles may be interleaved with non-syntactic ones, but it is normally not assumed that phonological information from previous cycles can actually interact with later syntactic cycles. Indeed, the crucial point here is not specific to the Y-model. Rather, it extends to any framework which assumes that the syntactic derivation does not have access to the phonological properties of the structures it manipulates, e.g. as a general principle of modularity or because phonological content is explicitly inserted at a late stage of the derivation after the narrow syntax has done its work. The EPP thus seems to involve a violation of modularity or counter-cyclicity. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which must simultaneously be able to handle its unique properties but must also be made to fit in with the broader theory of grammatical architecture. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will argue that such an approach will not only allow a more satisfactory account of the EPP itself, but can also yield a unification with the comp-trace effect and yield insight into how both of these interact with pro-drop.

In this paper I consider how syntactic trees as such can be recursively linearized with tree traversal/walk algorithm familiar in computer science. I show that for tree walk to be applicable to an inherently unordered syntactic tree, an asymmetry has to be established between the two subtrees of a parent tree, so that the latter may be unambiguously co-labeled with exactly one of its subtrees. In modifying Chomsky’s (2013,\\xa02015) labeling algorithm to serve the purpose, I discuss the implications the label-based linearization theory has for the labeling algorithm itself and for the syntactic phenomena it has been used to account for. The theory thus provides a direct support in favor of the SMT (Chomsky 2001 et seq) that the properties of syntactic computation are largely determined by interface conditions.

In this article I outline those conditions and the type of syntactic analysis required to account for them, claiming that an articulated left periphery is needed to account for the findings. The similarity of the V3 patterns found in these new varieties, which are geographically isolated from each other but which share a characterization in terms of the demographics of their speaker groups, invites a diachronic account in terms of language contact. I argue that transfer cannot account for V3, but that a scenario of sequential simplification and complexification is able to do so.

It addresses data that have not previously been analysed in the literature, involving so-called Boolean constructions (e.g. en la estación y la calle). Also, the paper shows that a single treatment can capture all the relevant data. Therefore, the analysis shows that polysemy is a grammar phenomenon that is better accounted for in architectures with a distinct syntactic/derivational component (e.g. Distributed Morphology), than in architectures lacking this component (e.g. Cognitive Linguistics approaches).

In particular, it was tested whether children’s choice between the prepositional dative construction and the double object construction (the so-called “dative alternation”) with the verb give was influenced by (i) the discourse givenness and topicality of themes and recipients, (ii) the situational necessity of contrast, and (iii) the use of the expected construction by the child’s interlocutor (prompt). The results provide evidence for the role of all factors, showing that four-and-a-half-year-olds are sensitive to the distinction between topics and foci and are able to produce contrastive topicalization. Although children did not produce an adult-like rate of contrastive topicalization strategies (which is tentatively explained by their underuse of gapping constructions), they did reveal adult-like preferences with respect to the choice of a dative construction that better matches the context. Children’s sensitivity to contrast is evidenced by the fact that children more frequently employed contrastive topicalization strategies as conditions increasingly required so — as well as the fact that in the presence of contrastive topicalization, topics and foci alike were categorically expressed as full noun phrases rather than pronouns. The paper provides further evidence for children’s early pragmatic competence, especially active knowledge of contrastive topicalization, demonstrated in their adult-like, pragmatic-sensitive use of the dative alternation.

By applying a coherent set of syntactic diagnostics, it is shown that these phenomena may be given the same analysis in both varieties: the discontiguity of the elements of the verbal cluster is the result of low verb movement of the lexical verb on the clausal spine. In a diachronic Romance comparative setting, the existence of low verb movement phenomena constitutes an important (yet overlooked) piece of evidence for the gradual emergence of V-to-I movement in the Latin-to-Romance transition. For the theory of diachronic linguistics in general, the preservation of interpolation and scrambling in Istro-Romanian shows that archaic phenomena may be preserved in isolated varieties, and that language contact (with Croatian in the case at hand) plays an important role in consolidating archaic features.',\n",

Prosodic smothering arises when the prosodic status of a clitic or affix varies with the presence or absence of some outer morpheme. We first illustrate prosodic smothering with novel data from two genetically unrelated languages, Macedonian (Slavic) and Kaqchikel (Mayan). We then provide a unified account of prosodic smothering based on a principled extension of the theory of prosodic subcategorization (Inkelas 1990, Peperkamp 1997, Chung 2003, Yu 2003, Paster 2006, Bye 2007, among others). Prosodic subcategorization typically involves requirements placed on items to the left or the right of the selecting morpheme. We show that prosodic smothering naturally emerges in a theory which also allows for subcategorization in the vertical dimension, such that morphemes may select for the prosodic category which immediately dominates them in surface prosodic structure. This extension successfully reduces two apparent cases of non-local prosodic conditioning to the effects of strictly local prosodic selection.',\n",

Open-mid allophones have consistently higher F1 realizations and more central F2 realizations than their close-mid counterparts, but are not consistently shorter. These results are problematic for accounts of the loi de position as a pattern of vowel reduction, with mid-vowel lowering and centralizing being caused by shortening. F1 and F2 distances between close-mid and open-mid allophones vary across different prosodic and consonantal contexts and these variations can be analyzed as resulting from duration-based undershoot.

Two contrasting views of the role of lexical meaning in the analysis of such variation can be found in the literature: (i) uniformity, whereby lexical meaning is universal, and variation arises from idiosyncratic differences in the inventory and phonological shape of language-particular functional material, and (ii) transparency, whereby systematic variation in form arises from systematic variation in the meaning of basic lexical items. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this volume, Itamar Francez and Andrew Koontz-Garboden contrast these views as applied to the empirical domain of property concept sentences - sentences expressing adjectival predication and their translational equivalents across languages. They demonstrate that property concept sentences vary systematically between possessive and predicative form, and propose a transparentist analysis of this variation that links it to the lexical denotations of basic property concept lexemes. At the heart of the analysis are qualities: mass-like model theoretic objects that closely resemble scales. The authors contrast their transparentist analysis with uniformitarian alternatives, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical advantages. They then show that the proposed theory of qualities can account for interesting and novel observations in two central domains of grammatical theory: the theory of syntactic categories, and the theory of mass nouns. The overall results highlight the importance of the lexicon as a locus of generalizations about the limits of crosslinguistic variation. ',\n",

This paper explores the granularity with which these verbs\\' semantic and pragmatic properties are recoverable from their syntactic distributions, using three behavioral experiments aimed at explicitly quantifying the relationship between these two sets of properties. Experiment 1 gathers a measure of 30 propositional attitude verbs\\' syntactic distributions using an acceptability judgment task. Experiments 2a and 2b gather measures of semantic similarity between those same verbs using a generalized semantic discrimination (triad or \"odd man out\") task and an ordinal (Likert) scale task, respectively. Two kinds of analyses are conducted on the data from these experiments. The first compares both the acceptability judgments and the semantic similarity judgments to previous classifications derived from the syntax and semantics literature. The second kind compares the acceptability judgments to the semantic similarity judgments directly. Through these comparisons, we show that there is quite fine-grained information about propositional attitude verbs\\' semantics carried in their syntactic distributions – whether one considers the sorts of discrete qualitative classifications that linguists traditionally work with or the sorts of continuous quantitative classifications that can be derived experimentally.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: a previous version of this manuscript, entitled \"Projecting attitudes\", was previously submitted to LingBuzz.

Following Frege, we define two different layers of meaning for each node in a syntactic parse tree: a sense and a referent. The referent of a node is defined as its conventional denotation, which can be computed recursively from the leaves up to the root of the tree. We choose to establish an equivalence between intensions and syntactic nodes by defining the sense of a node as the node itself. Then, we define the English word “that” as a sense abstractor: in other words, it returns as a referent the sense of the clause that it introduces. We also allow a new lambda theoretic type for LF-subtrees so that denotations of words can take intensions as arguments. Thus, this formalism gives us an alternative way of dealing with intensionality. As we show with example derivations of relative clause structures and sentences with “only”, it also handles trace binding and alternative-sensitive words without special-case composition rules like predicate abstraction. Thus, we can understand sense abstraction as a formal framework that unifies our treatment of intensionality, predicate abstraction, and alternative semantics.\\r\\n',\n",

All other contemplable cases of reduplicative structures are properly treated as either phonological doubling, lexical sequencing or (special cases of) compounding. An OT analysis is offered which suggests that both rhyme and ablaut reduplication may emerge when a segmentally and prosodically unspecified expressive morpheme is attached to a base - given that the base strictly obeys certain word prosodic requirements.\\r\\nThe present approach eschews constraints that make explicit reference to base-reduplicant correspondence. The OT grammar successfully models the emergence of the fixed bipedal structure, the obligatory segmental deviance of the reduplicant, non-exponence of the expressive morpheme in the case of non-trochaic bases, the variable linearization of base and reduplicant in ablaut reduplication, and the interaction of reduplication with i) segmental alternations and ii) onset complexity.\\r\\nCertain (cross-linguistic) correlations regarding constraints on reduplicative word formation and poetic devices, such as rhyme and meter, are discussed.',\n",

It is claimed that the naming (not describing) of an entity type is what makes a noun a noun (formally, what turns a root into a noun). An ‘entity type’ is understood as an e-type element in the speaker’s ontology, not yet determined as denoting over kinds or their object instances. Higher projections turn this into a predicate, and further grammatical specifications may restrict its reference to what is modelled as elements of a partition, or as atoms, but without a single countability switch. Whether the reference is to kinds or to instances depends on all the specifications that jointly define a division of reference. In particular, plurality enforces an instance reading where the partition it determines is based on spatiotemporally situated parts, in the absence of other criteria for individuality. Beside determining what types of plurals may not license a kind reading, this view of the division of reference analyzes fake mass nouns ('furniture') as a count structure inside a mass shell, which predictively relates their semantics to their morphology. The same analytical framework, with no additional stipulations, explains the properties of non-countable plural nouns, both arising from mass nouns ('waters') and from non-nominal bases ('beginnings'). Finally, a case of mixed-gender DP shows that unexpected interactions between gender and number can be interpreted as cases where the determination of an agreement class is bound up with the determination of part structure. \",\n",

We argue that there is a projected implicit external argument in passive se constructions in both languages, based on an available inalienable possession interpretation of body parts. These constructions, however, differ from each other in one important way: Romanian passive se allows a by-phrase, while Spanish passive se shows severe restrictions. Moreover, we illustrate that in Old Spanish, passive se freely allowed by-phrases. Thus, Modern Romanian reflects an earlier stage of Spanish. We propose a linguistic cycle to explain these differences, where Spanish and Romanian are at different stages of that cycle. The approach offers an explanation for a general pattern within Romance where by-phrases are initially grammatical with passive se, but then become ungrammatical over time, a pattern to date that has not been explained.  It also offers a thereotical account for why some languages do not develop passive se constructions. ',\n",

       "              'We provide an analysis of focus and exhaustive focus in the Grassfields Bantu language Awing. We show that Awing provides an exceptionally clear window into the syntactic properties of exhaustive focus. Our analysis reveals that the Awing particle LE realizes a left-peripheral head which, in terms of its syntactic position in the functional sequence, closely corresponds to the Foc(us) head in standard cartographic analyses (e.g. Rizzi 1997). Crucially, however, we show that LE is only used if the focus it associates with receives a presuppositional exhaustive (cleft-like) interpretation. Other types of focus are not formally encoded in Awing. In order to reflect this semantic specification of LE, we call its syntactic category Exh rather than Foc. Another point of difference from what one would consider a \"standard\" cartographic Foc head is that the focus associated with LE is not realized in its specifier but rather within its complement. More particularly, we argue that LE associates with the closest maximal projection it asymmetrically c-commands. The broader theoretical relevance of the present work is at least two-fold. First, our paper offers novel evidence in support of Horvath\\'s (2010) Strong Modularity Hypothesis for Discourse Features, according to which information structural notions such as focus cannot be represented in narrow syntax as formal features. We argue that the information structure-related movement operations that Awing exhibits can be accounted for by interface considerations, in the spirit of Reinhart (2006). Second, our data support the generality of the so called closeness requirement on association with focus Jacobs (1983), which dictates that a focus-sensitive particle be as close to its focus as possible (in terms of c-command). What is of special significance is the fact that Awing exhibits two different avenues to satisfying closeness. The standard one - previously described for German or Vietnamese and witnessed here for the Awing particle TSOE \\'only\\' - relies primarily on the flexible attachment of the focus-sensitive particle. The Awing particle LE, in contrast, is syntactically rigid. For that reason, the satisfaction of closeness relies solely on the flexibility of other syntactic constituents.',\n",

Building on Hernanz (2007 and subsequent work), we propose that sí, which marks focal affirmative polarity, originates in ΣP and then moves to FocusP. By contrast, sí que is directly merged in AssertiveP in the left periphery, since it emphasizes the truth of the proposition. Thus, we argue that sí que involves more CP structure than sí, which makes a variety of correct empirical predictions. Additionally, several facts indicate that sí que behaves much like a predicate of truth, which further substantiates the AssertiveP analysis advocated here. We then investigate the possibility that que in such contexts also performs an echoic function, along the lines of Demonte & Fernández-Soriano (2014). More generally, the findings reported here allow us to draw a more accurate mapping of the Spanish left periphery, a topic of much discussion in the Romance literature. \\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

Whether a grammatical object is an affix, or a clitic, or a prefix is something that is idiosyncratically indicated for each morpheme in its lexical entry. However, certain generalizations about the morphology of some grammatical objects suggest that an alternative way of thinking about the identity of morphological objects is needed. It seems to be the case that (at least) some grammatical objects have the morphological identity they do because of the syntactic configuration they must appear in. With this background, in this paper, we claim that a topic marker or a focus sensitive particle cannot be an affix. This follows from two assumptions: (1) the projections of the topic or focus(sensitive) heads cannot form head-chains with their complement and (2) affixhood is the interpretation (i.e. the spell-out) of head adjunction. We conclude that affixhood should not be taken to be a primitive concept of the linguistic analysis.',\n",

Empirically, we closely examine hitherto unexplored verb “triplets” (Suga, 1980; de Chene, 2016), in which the same lexical roots are shared by multiple transitive/intransitive verbs with different transitivity morphology, and reveal their differential syntactic behaviors in the interpretation of external arguments (between multiple transitive verbs sharing the same root) and unaccusativity (between multiple intransitive verbs sharing the same root). Theoretically, within the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz, 1993), we propose the system in which transitivity morphology, previously identified as little v (Volpe, 2005; Harley, 2008; Marantz, 2013), is analyzed as Voice morphology differently specified regarding the presence/absence of external arguments (Schafer, 2008; Marantz, 2013; Wood, 2015; Alexiadou et al., 2015), and explain the syntax of transitivity alternations. Furthermore, the proposed Voice system will be extended to the broader empirical domain of Japanese argument structures and derive ditransitive verbs, “figure ditransitive” verbs, and syntactic causatives/passives. Finally, we discuss several theoretical consequences of our proposal concerning (i) lexical vs. syntactic approaches to argument structure, (ii) the distinctness of Voice and little v (Harley, 2013; Legate, 2014), and (iii) the unification of argument-introducing functional heads under i* (Wood & Marantz, 2017).',\n",

To this end, I present evidence from a linguistic phenomenon where grammatical perspective has long been observed to play a central role — namely, non-local anaphora (a cover-term not only for long-distance anaphora and backward anaphora but also for logophora). The evidence that I provide comes primarily from Tamil, a language of the Dravidian family, spoken predominantly in parts of South India. Non-local anaphora in Tamil, like in Icelandic, Italian, Japanese and in its fellow Dravidian language Malayalam, is perspective-driven: i.e. the antecedent of a successfully bound anaphor must denote a mental or spatio-temporal perspective-holder toward some predication containing the anaphor. However, unlike the other languages mentioned here, Tamil provides compelling evidence in the form of verbal agreement that the perspective that regulates anaphoric dependencies is syntactically represented. In particular, I will argue that the agreement marking that obtains on the clausemate verb of the anaphor in Tamil, when this anaphor occurs in nominative case (the case that generally feeds agreement), seems to be anomalously triggered, not by the anaphor or by its antecedent, but by a silent perspectival pronoun local to the verb. Assuming that agreement is a morphosyntactic process, such a thesis, if correct, then entails that perspective must be syntactically (i.e. structurally and featurally) instantiated.',\n",

This paper also emphasizes that this neutral value on a scale is not an 'extension gap', but rather the intersection of two 'negative extensions'. The formalism of the analysis is implemented with interval arithmetic.

However, we contend that greater restrictiveness can be achieved through morphotactic constraints and repairs in the Generalized Reduplication formalism, triggered by a Noninitiality condition on the positioning of the plural affix, and develop a set of conditions on these operations that situate the locus of interspeaker variation within the postsyntactic component.',\n",

       "              'In many languages with ergative morphology, transitive subjects(i.e. ergatives) are unable to undergo A’-extraction. This extraction asymmetry is a common hallmark of “syntactic ergativity,” and is found in a range of typologically diverse languages (see e.g. Deal 2016; Polinsky to appear, and works cited there). In Kaqchikel, the A’-extraction of transitive subjects requires a special verb form, known in Mayanist literature as Agent Focus (AF). In a recent paper, Erlewine (2015) argues the restriction on A’-extracting transitive subjects in Kaqchikel is the result of an Anti-Locality effect: transitive subjects are not permitted to extract because they are too close to C. This analysis relies crucially on Erlewine’s proposal that transitive subjects undergo movement to Spec,IP while intransitive subjects remain low. For Erlewine, this derives the fact that transitive (ergative) subjects, but not intransitive (absolutive) subjects are subject to extraction restrictions. Furthermore, it makes the strong prediction that phrasal material intervening between IP and CP should obviate the need for AF in clauses with subject extraction. In this paper, we argue against the Anti-Locality analysis of ergative A’-extraction restrictions along two lines. First, we raise concerns with the proposal that transitive, but not intransitive subjects, move to Spec,IP. Our second, and main focus, is to show that there is variation in whether AF is observed in configurations intervening phrasal material, with a primary focus on intervening adverbs. We propose an alternative account for the variation in whether AF is observed in the presence of adverbs and discuss consequences for accounts of ergative extraction asymmetries more generally.',\n",

The characteristic property of this pattern is the sometimes implicit, but often overt and obligatory presence of a locative PP which embeds a body-part noun in a VP which is otherwise monotransitive. Figure reflexive constructions are syntactically unified by the fact that their internal argument is conceptualized as a prepositional small clause, which introduces the Figure-Ground relation. These constructions are also Voiced, in the sense that an external argument position is projected even if it may be non-thematic. Unaccusatives are analyzed as introducing an expletive, i.e. non-thematic Voice projection, whose role is simply to signal that the event structure of transitives and derived unaccusatives is the same, consisting of a causing subevent and a result state. The discussion of unaccusatives is theoretically relevant in that it strengthens the suggestion that there is a connection between the expletivization of Voice and derived reflexive unaccusativity.',\n",

Both analyses attribute the factive island effect to a pathology of meaning, but they take different views regarding the semantic and pragmatic ingredients of this pathology. On Oshima’s analysis, the perceived ungrammaticality in factive islands is due to a conflict between two felicity conditions on wh-questions. In contrast, without postulating felicity conditions particular to questions, Abrusán credits factive islands to universally projected contradictory presuppositions. After reformulating and fleshing out the two analyses in order to facilitate comparison, we argue that Oshima’s analysis is supported by independent evidence while Abrusán’s is not. This result informs the ongoing debate regarding the proper notion of meaning triviality that induces judgments of ungrammaticality (Gajewski 2009, Abrusán 2014, Del Pinal 2017). It suggests that in order to properly apply to wh-questions, a comprehensive theory of this notion must make reference to felicity conditions on questions, and that meaning-based ungrammaticality cannot uniformly be attributed to the triviality of propositional content.',\n",

Some V1 languages are strictly VSO, others are VOS, and a significant number combine both orders. This chapter focuses on data from VSO/VOS languages and the factors that underlie these alternations. A number of V1 languages can be more adequately characterized as predicate-initial, with V1 being just a subset of clause-initial predicates.  The chapter presents a number of structural properties that are or may be associated with V1 and discusses possible implicational relations between such properties and V1. While there are certain common characteristics observed across V1 languages, it is also clear that there are several distinct subtypes of V1. These subtypes call for different syntactic analyses; main approaches include the derivation of V1 via phrasal movement (VP-raising) and its derivation via head-movement (verb-raising). Other syntactic approaches to the derivation of V1 include the parametrization of specifier direction within a single language, non-configurational syntax, and subject lowering. In addition to these purely syntactic analyses, several recent approaches place the derivation of V1 outside syntax or at the syntax-PF interface. Careful, in-depth analyses of individual languages are required to test the different approaches to V1; in quite a few cases such analyses are still lacking.',\n",

In nominative and accusative contexts, the second noun (N2) is marked with partitive case while the first noun/numeral (N1) is marked with the case of the pseudopartitive. In all other case contexts both nouns must bear the case of the pseudopartitive. I propose that the partitive case on N2 is an unmarked case in the sense of Baker (2015) and Marantz (1991), among others. It is assigned to complements of nouns that do not already have a case value. This derives the case-marking alternation as a matter of timing: nominative and accusative are assigned too late to affect case-marking internal to the pseudopartitive. I show that pseudopartitives are not amenable to an analysis in terms of case-stacking as has been proposed for similar phenomena. The analysis presented here also extends to collocations of numerals and pseudopartitives in Estonian. I also show how the analysis can be extended to account for differences between Finnish and Estonian, and I suggest a typology of pseudopartitive-marking predicted by the analysis I propose. The analysis has implications for case realization and assignment as well as pseudopartitive and DP structure.',\n",

May bare nouns in such languages simply be read as definites or indefinites, without constraint?

In these languages, singular and plural bare nouns present different possibilities for indefinite interpretation, in a way that receives a natural explanation within a neo-Carlsonian theory of noun meaning (Chierchia 1998). This makes for a close connection between the meanings of bare nouns in English and those in Hindi and Russian. Does this connection extend to the meanings of bare nouns in number-marking languages in general, even outside of Indo-European? In this paper, we demonstrate that the answer is yes. Our evidence comes from bare noun interpretation in Teotitlán del Valle Zapotec, a language of Oaxaca, Mexico. The Zapotec findings closely replicate Dayal's findings for Indo-European languages, providing support for the viability of the neo-Carlsonian approach as a set of constraints on semantic variation in general.\",\n",

To illustrate this, I will inves- tigate the interaction between Case alignment and instrumental voice constructions (hereafter IVCs) in Ixil (Mayan) (Dayley 1981; Ayres 1983, 1991). In particular, I will address the unexpected emergence of the ergative in a subcase of IVCs: unergatives and unaccusatives. This occurs when an instrumental phrase is fronted to clause-initial position. I will claim that the fronted instrumental phrase feeds the assignment of ergative Case, adopting a recent phase-based analysis of dependent ergative case (Baker 2014, 2015).

We provide a unified analysis for epistemic and predictive readings as epistemic necessity, and the shift between the two is determined compositionally by the lower tense. Our account thus acknowledges a systematic interaction between modality and tense— but the future itself is a pure modal, not a mixed temporal/modal operator. We show that the modal base of the future is nonveridical, i.e. it includes p and ¬p worlds, parallel to epistemic modals such as MUST, and present arguments that future morphemes are a category that stands in between epistemic modals and predicates of personal taste.

Under the proposed analysis, the problem with the movement of YP out of moved element XP does not arise at the point of movement of YP out of XP, as has been previously assumed; the problem arises already with the movement of XP, i.e. XP itself cannot undergo movement in this case—any later movement out of moved XP is then trivially blocked. The proposed deduction of the ban in question leaves room for movement out of moved elements to take place in one well-defined context, which is shown to be borne out. The paper also has consequences for the timing of labeling and provides a new perspective on the traditional Adjunct Condition (i.e. the ban on movement out of adjuncts). It is shown that movement out of adjuncts is possible in the same configuration as movement out of moved elements. The proposed account of the ban on movement out of moved elements is then extended to the Adjunct Condition based on a new treatment of adjuncts.',\n",

Departing from both transformational and earlier lexicalist approaches to nominalizations, I first argue on the basis of English and Finnish evidence that gerunds are not DPs built on heads that embed an extended verbal projection (Baker & Vinokurova 2009, Kornfilt & Whitman 2011), but IPs that need Case. They are categorially verbal at all levels of the syntax, including having structural subjects rather than possessor specifiers. Their nominal behavior is entirely due to the unvalued Case feature borne by their Infl head, which they share with all participial verb forms. I then argue that agent nominalizations are categorially nominal at all levels of the syntax, and that the verb-like case assignment of transitive agent nominalizations is due to the verbal Aspect feature borne by their nominalizing head. Vedic Sanskrit, Northern Paiute, and Sakha evidence is shown to favor this analysis over B&V’s analysis of intransitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Voice heads and of transitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Aspect heads. The two “mixed” categories –-- gerunds and transitive nominalizations –-- thus prove to be formally duals in that they are respectively verbs with Case and nouns with Aspect.',\n",

       "              'Haspelmath (2006) argues that the concept of markedness is confused and problematic. He urges linguists to dispense with the term. One principle criticism is that markedness solutions seem always to require further explanation rather than actually providing answers (Samuels 2011). Concordantly, Hale & Reiss (2000, 2008), pioneers of Substance Free Phonology (SFP) argue that markedness has no place in what should be a formal theory of linguistic competence, thereby excluding phonetics and diachrony. Accepting the significant merit of these strains of thought (and many of their conclusions), this paper shows that there is nonetheless space for a theory of markedness in formal phonology. By examining markedness from a highly representational viewpoint, I will show that ‘markedness as complexity’ does have an explanatory role, at least for syllable structure. I will demonstrate that markedness is explicable in terms of ‘structural complexity’ and ‘length of description’. The core demonstration will be Charette’s (1990, 1991, 1992) typology and analysis of consonant clusters (CCs). Her papers discovered important implicational universals she related these directly to representations. As well as enriching the typology, my contribution will be to arrange the principles and parameters into a decision tree that derives the implicational universals. I will demonstrate that the number of parameter settings (the depth in the decision tree) increases the markedness of the resultant grammar (cf. Ulfsbjorninn 2014). Each parametric ‘yes’ setting corresponds to an extra empty phonological category or extra ability to license in the representation. For this reason, markedness is not merely a ‘metaphor’ ‘for a cognitive state’ (Haspelmath 2006), it is directly convertible into linguistic categories. This markedness is still ‘extra-grammatical’; it is not part of the computation of forms (contra Optimality Theory) and markedness statements cannot be re-ranked to obtain different grammars. However, markedness is one step in the chain of explanation for: (a) the apparent step-wise variation of complexity and implicational universals of consonant clusters. (b) the Trubetzkoy hypothesis. I will defend markedness in the same terms as Gurevich (2001) criticises it: ‘[as a] an encoding of a universal ‘naturalness’ in the phonology’. Crucially, this naturalness is a product internal to the phonology (adjacency, licensing, parameter settings) and not grounded in phonetics. ',\n",

In this paper, I argue that IC is a morpheme, specifically an infix, and that its distribution is best explained by positing that the morpheme marks [+realis] mood. The major theoretical claim of this study is the following. IC, being the [+realis] morpheme in Arapaho, appears in a high functional projection in the clause, namely C; it is analyzed as the spell-out of C[+realis]. As such, it competes for this position with a number of morphemes belonging to the CP domain in the language. I will argue that the competition for the C head is driven by the structural properties of the verbal morphology rather than by specific features expressed by the competing morphemes. More specifically, I will suggest that Arapaho is a simple CP language, meaning that only one C head can be present in a clause at a time.',\n",

       "              'Devoicing of high vowels (HVD) in Tokyo Japanese applies in two environments—between voiceless consonants, and between a voiceless consonant and a “pause”—and applies variably as a function of a number of factors. The role and definition of “pause” in this process, in terms of a physical pause or prosodic position (word or phrase boundary), remains unclear, as does what is expected when these environments overlap, and why HVD appears to be categorical in some environments and variable in others. This paper addresses three outstanding issues about HVD—the role of “boundary phenomena” (prosodic position and physical pauses), the relationship between the two environments, and the sources of variability in HVD—by examining vowel devoicing in a large corpus of spontaneous Japanese. We use mixed-effects logistic regression to model how boundary phenomena affect the likelihood of devoicing and modulate the effects of other variables, controlling for other major factors, including a measure of gestural overlap. The results suggest that all boundary phenomena jointly affect devoicing rate, and that prosodic phrase boundaries play a key role: variability in HVD looks qualitatively different for phrase-internal and phrase-final vowels, which are affected differently by word frequency, speech rate, and pause duration. We argue the results support an account of HVD as the result of two overlapping vowel devoicing processes, each widely-attested cross-linguistically: devoicing between voiceless consonants, and devoicing before prosodic phrase boundaries. Variability in the application of these two processes can then be partially explained in terms of aspects of phonetic implementation and processing: gestural overlap (Beckman, 1996), which often plays a role in reduction processes, and the locality of production planning (Wagner, 2012), a recent explanation for variability in the application of external sandhi processes.',\n",

One possible explanation for this difference is that non-standardization blurs the boundaries of grammatical variants and increases grammatical fluidity. Affected by such factors, bilectals become less accurate in identifying the variety to which a grammatical variant pertains. Another explanation is that their differential performance derives from the fact that they are competent in two varieties. Under this scenario, the difference is due to the existence of two linguistic systems in the course of development, and not to how close or standardized these systems are. This study employs a novel variety-judgment task in order to elucidate which of the two explanations holds. Having administered the task to monolinguals, bilectals, and bilinguals, including heritage language learners and L1 attriters, we obtained a dataset of 16,245 sentences. The analysis shows differential performance between bilectal and bilingual speakers, granting support for the first explanation.

This proposal is problematic since the correlation between tense and the belief v. desire distinction is not cross-linguistically robust, yet the acquisition profile for these verbs appears to be identical cross-linguistically. Thus, a story on which a particular syntactic feature—such as tense—cues the learner to the appropriate label for a particular semantic distinction—belief v. desire—will not work unmodified. Our proposal in this chapter is that, rather than being cued to a semantic distinction, like belief v. desire, by a particular syntactic feature, like subordinate clause tense, learners may utilize more abstract syntactic cues, whose instantiation is constrained to a small set of possible syntactic feature configurations, but must ultimately be tuned to the syntactic distinctions present in a particular language.',\n",

I argue, contra Chomsky (ibid.), that a category raised into the Criterial Position should not be able to move up further in the derivational system of Labeling Algorithm. In Scandinavian Object Shift (Holmberg 1986), the object pronoun can exceptionally move out of the Spec of R, which is the Criterial Position for objects in the unmarked case in which they complete the valuation of their unvalued Case feature. In Icelandic Stylistic Fronting (Holmberg 2000), the categories that do not have any feature(s) in which they should agree with T can exceptionally move to the Spec of T, which is a typical Criterial Position claimed in the literature (Rizzi 2015). On the basis of the literature (Hosono 2013, Holmberg 2000), I propose that these kinds of exceptional syntactic movement from/into the Criterial Position in which a raised category does not have any unvalued feature(s) (in which it should agree with a head in a raised position) can occur only when it is required from phonology. I also suggest that a sentential element without any unvalued feature(s) can merge (either externally or internally) to a lower position/Spec of a head the projection of which has already been labeled: when a higher syntactic object is already labeled, a syntactic object inside it does not need a new label, with a sentential element merged (either externally or internally) to a lower position/Spec unnecessary to agree with any head.',\n",

       "              'The received wisdom is that word order alternations in Slavic languages arise as a direct consequence of word order-related information structure constraints such as \"place given expressions before new ones\". In this paper, we compare the word order hypothesis with a competing one, according to which word order alternations arise as a consequence of a prosodic constraint – \"avoid stress on given expressions\". Based on novel experimental and modeling data, we conclude that the prosodic hypothesis is more adequate than the word order hypothesis. Yet, we also show that combining the strengths of both hypotheses provides the best fit for the data. Methodologically, our paper is based on gradient acceptability judgments and multiple regression, which allows us to evaluate whether violations of generalizations like \"given precedes new\" or \"given lacks stress\" lead to a consistent decrease in acceptability and to quantify the size of their respective effects. Focusing on the empirical adequacy of such generalizations rather than specific theoretical implementations also makes it possible to bridge the gap between different linguistic traditions, and to directly compare predictions emerging from formal and functional approaches.',\n",

My account relies only on two freely-applying type-shifters: the first is Karttunen’s (1977) proto-question operator, aka Partee’s (1986) IDENT, and the second can be factored out of extant approaches to the semantics of questions in the tradition of Karttunen (1977). These type-shifters form a decomposition of LIFT, the familiar function mapping values into scope-takers. Exceptional scope of alternative-generating expressions arises via (snowballing) scopal pied-piping.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an empirical focus on English indefinites, I argue that this approach to alternatives improves on standard alternative-semantic architectures that use point-wise composition to subvert islands (and, more generally, on in situ approaches to indefinites). Specifically, unlike grammars based on point-wise composition, scope-based alternative management is thoroughly categorematic, does not under-generate readings when multiple indefinites occur on an island, and is readily compatible with standard treatments of binding. I explore two generalizations of the basic theory: one is oriented around assignment-relative sets of alternatives, and the other incorporates a dynamic perspective on assignment functions. The upshot is that dynamic semantics can be seen as a strict extension of alternative semantics, with the initial results (including island insensitivity for alternative generators) preserved.',\n",

I look at the negative verbal prefixes de- (deactivate), dis- (dishonour), un- (untie), competing for expressing ‘the undoing of a previous state’ (Marchand 1972:636), and the prefix mis- (misdiagnose), expressing the meaning ‘to do something badly’, and at the corresponding prefixes de- (deactiva ‘deactivate’), des/dez- (dezonora ‘dishonour’), dis- (dispărea ‘disappear’) in Romanian; there is no counterpart for mis-. I embrace the view that verbal prefixes scope lower than negation, since to deconstruct does not mean ‘not to construct’ (Lakoff 1969, Hust 1975), and I lexically decompose disassemble as ‘cause to no longer be assembled’, misdiagnose as ‘give a not correct diagnosis’ a.o. Ultimately, I recast the lexical decompositions into first phase syntax and make use of spanning, a framework which spells out spans (i.e. extended projections), dismisses intermediate labels and uses direct linearization: the span spells out at a certain height (specifiers to the left of the heads, complements to the right).

However, there has not been much empirical study on how much information those smaller units (called ‘mini-graphemes’ in the context) deliver. In this work, the relative amount of information one stroke conveys in Korean Hangul and Japanese Katakana is analyzed and compared extensively with 1676 most frequently used vocabulary pairs. Korean Hangul and Japanese Katakana have good characteristics to be the research subjects. First, they are almost entirely made with clearly distinguishable strokes which make it easy to count their numbers. Circles in Hangul and Katakana, the only mini-graphemes which are not a stroke, can be considered as one stroke without loss of generality. Second, it is easy to find one-to-one mappings of Korean and Japanese words. Because words of similar meanings but with different nuances can make the analysis result of this work less precise, it is important to select two target languages like Korean and Japanese which can be translated into each other with much of their subtle meanings kept intact. The analysis has shown that one stroke in Hangul is 21.20% less informative than its counterpart in Katakana: on average 0.7880 (which is 1 - 21.20%) Katakana strokes are needed to express the meaning conveyed in 1 Hangul stroke. In detail, the average ratio of the number of strokes of Katakana to Hangul for each word pair is 0.7880 and the standard deviation is 0.3538. This research is by far the first research which addressed the amount of information conveyed by strokes of writing systems.

The authors propose to define the distinctions by referring to derivational stages, namely by distinguishing levels of insertion for morphemes. Most of what is usually classified as derivational morphology and subject to Williams’s (1981) Right Hand Head Rule are morphemes which enter derivations in narrow syntax. As such, they conform to what is here termed a Logical Form Interpretation Condition, which allows only one syntactic feature per morpheme. On the other hand, morphemes such as agreements are not subject to the Right Hand Head Rule and result from post-syntactic insertion and exhibit cross-classification. The authors propose that the source of these bound inflections is the process of Alternative Realisation.  They argue that their new distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology correlates with testable semantic, phonetic and syntactic properties and that in terms of these properties, both are necessary parts of an adequate formal linguistic framework. A curious aspect of the conclusions is that W. Humboldt's division in 1820 between morphemes that express several features (inflection) and those which express only one (agglutination) turns out to be the best analysis, with the majority of affixes felt to be 'inflections' by todayS linguists of almost all persuasions (mood, tense, noun plurals, ádjectival comparison, etc.) turn out not to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

In languages such as Washo (Hokan) or Hare (Athapaskan), morphemes that express indirect evidentiality can also be used to express mirativity (DeLancey 2001, Aikhenvald 2004, 2012). In Turkish, the present perfect can express all three semantic interpretations: present perfect (PPA), indirect evidentiality (IE), and mirativity (MIR). The question therefore arises what common element links these three interpretations and the particular pairings observed (PPA-IE, IE-MIR, PPA-IE-MIR). Previous accounts such as Bybee & Dahl (1989) and Izvorski (2007) only account for a single link in the triad: PPA-IE. We propose that a proper account of the relations between PPA, IE, and MIR requires that mirativity be redefined in terms of ‘sudden discovery or realisation’ (Adelaar 1977, 2012, Mexas 2016).). This redefinition allows us to explain the link between PPA, IE, and MIR in terms of the temporal nature of the traditional aspectual classes: states, processes, accomplishments, and achievements (Vendler 1967, Mourelatos 1979). Indirect evidentiality can then be viewed as the evidential counterpart of an accomplishment in the aspectual sense, while the category of mirativity should be viewed as the mirror image of achievements.

The counterfactual behaves like an ordinary one in several ways, but differs from it in ways that are predictable from its lexical entry.  The counterfactual\\'s ability to save \"almost\"-at-a-distance is blocked when the temporal properties of the modal anchor and Davidsonian event prevent normal outcomes from coming true when they need to.  Also, non-propositional complements of \"almost\" block \"almost\"-at-a-distance by restricting the same temporal properties and preventing normal outcomes from coming true when they need to. \\r\\n \\r\\n This approach to \"almost\" differs sharply from the two general approaches that have emerged in the literature, by replacing the negative polar condition (not p) with a positive `antecedent condition\\' that entails not p while avoiding the numerous well-documented complications of employing a polar condition.

Since coordination structures are robust islands, it can be shown that, at least in these 9 languages, movement cannot be a necessary condition for DOM.

Using Villalta’s (2008) analysis of the subjunctive mood in Spanish, I will argue that the limitations on the occurrence of the topic position in complement clauses are due to the semantic properties of these clauses and the predicates that select them.

This claim has been supported by a range of multidomain effects which single out INFL as an independent constituent. Such effects led to the hypothesis that INFL in Bantu is of the same category as auxiliary verbs found in auxiliary–participle constructions. This paper investigates syntactic, morphological and phonological complexity effects in Northern Ndebele verbs and concludes that INFL in this language cannot be treated as a type of auxiliary. This conclusion is reached through a detailed comparison of INFL and verbal auxiliaries, revealing striking asymmetries, syntactic and phonological, between the two. The autonomy of INFL is argued to be a reflex of how verbal morphology is organized into complex heads in Bantu languages. In particular, the boundary between INFL and V-stem is modeled as a boundary between complex syntactic heads, and is not indicative of compound-tense syntax. ',\n",

Evidence will be drawn primarily from Malayalam (Dravidian), which has been argued to disallow long-distance wh-in-situ with finite embedded clauses.

This view has been motivated in part by the observation that the classic GB theory of 'pro' as a minimally specified nominal whose features are supplied by Infl is incompatible with the approach to feature theory developed in the Minimalist Program (Chomsky l995, 2001 and subsequent work). In this framework, the φ-features in T are assumed to be uninterpretable, hence unvalued. This raises a problem for the idea that subject pro is inherently unspecified for φ-features. \\r\\n\\tConcomitantly, recent theories of the nature of pronouns (Elbourne 2005) have posited a phonologically null NP as a complement of D in every pronoun (an NP affected by deletion, in the case of E-type pronouns, or a default, nearly semantically empty nominal [NP e] in the case of regular pronouns). This proposal reintroduces the need to posit a null, minimally specified NP in the grammar, thus reopening the issue of whether 'pro' can be reduced to an instance of [NP e]. Here we offer an analysis of different types of subject pro-drop that attempts to reduce pro to the very same [NP e] that occurs as complement of D in pronouns or is independently attested in cases of null NP anaphora (in the spirit of Tomioka 2003).\",\n",

This paper derives analogous faithfulness conditions for HG idempotency and output-drivenness and develops an intuitive interpretation of the various OT and HG faithfulness conditions thus obtained. The intuition is that faithfulness constraints measure the phonological distance between underlying and output forms. They should thus comply with a crucial axiom of the definition of distance, namely that any side of a triangle is shorter than the sum of the other two sides. This intuition leads to a faithfulness triangle inequality which is shown to be equivalent to the faithfulness conditions for idempotency and output-drivenness.

I explore the projection patterns under CF for standard presupposition triggers and co-speech gestures and conclude that the two pattern closely together. I show that non-projection under CF can be caused locally, when the assertive content of the focused elements of the CF alternatives is not contrastable enough, so CF has to associate with the presuppositional content, for which the latter needs to be accommodated. Non-projection can also be caused globally, when the presupposition of one of the CF alternatives contradicts the presupposition or assertion of some other alternative, which I derive via the alternative assertability principle. I also look at supplements, namely, non-restrictive relative clauses, which interact with CF differently from standard presuppositions and inferences triggered by co-speech gestures. The observed differences are mostly attributable to the configurational properties of the different types of non-at-issue content, so it is unclear to what extent the data investigated in this paper could be used to independently argue for the presuppositional analysis of co-speech gestures and against the supplemental one.',\n",

Further, we argue that tense/mood suffixes are associated with different cophonologies (Inkelas & Zoll 2007) depending on which stem syllable they assign accent to and whether they enforce iterative iambs or trochees. Finally, in Ese’eja when accent is assigned outside the window, the position of primary prominence falls on a position which is rhythmically dependent on the window-external accent, e.g. uniformly two syllables away, termed ‘Rhythmic Repair’.

We show that the data can only be explained if the prefix and the root form a constituent to the exclusion of all other verbal morphology, including the so-called theme marker: [[pref root] theme]. However, there are other phonological processes in Czech (infinitival lengthening), which suggest that the root and the theme marker form a constituent to the exclusion of the prefix: [pref [root theme]]. We argue that the apparent contradiction is resolved by prefix movement (Svenonius 2004). The prefix and the root are merged together, and there is a cycle of phonological computation that determines the vowel/zero status of the alternation site in the prefix. After the first cycle, the theme marker is added and the prefix moves higher up in the structure. This creates a remnant constituent containing just the root and the theme marker, and it is this remnant constituent that is subject to the infinitival lengthening.',\n",

       "              \"Rich data gathered in experimental primatology in the last 40 years are beginning to benefit from analytical methods used in contemporary linguistics, especially in the area of semantics and pragmatics.  These methods have started to clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any, do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the 'lexical meaning' of individual calls? (iii) how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve?  Four case studies from this emerging field of 'primate linguistics' provide initial answers, pertaining to Old World monkeys (Putty-nosed monkeys, Campbell's monkeys and Colobus monkeys) and New World monkeys (black-fronted Titi monkeys). The morphology mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell's -oo) one finds a root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call concatenation can be analyzed as being semantically conjunctive. But a key question concerns the division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context ('world' knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation in the semantics (Campbell's krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack sequences) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of 'urgency'. Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in complex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context. With respect to call evolution, the remarkable preservation of call form and function over millions of years should make it possible to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, illustrated with cercopithecine booms. \",\n",

       "              'Modern generative linguistic theory furnishes a variety of general principles that appear to be at work in the grammar of all the world’s languages. One of the most basic and uncontroversial of these principles is that Agree/Move operates according to the principle of attract closest, whereby the closest suitable goal must be the target for the relevant operation (Rizzi 1990; Chomsky 1995, 2000; Richards 1998). As first pointed out by Seiter (1980), the operation of raising in the Polynesian language Niuean (Tongic subgroup) raises suspicions as to whether this principle is truly at work in all languages. Niuean raising, despite patterning under all relevant diagnostics as A-movement, may felicitously target objects in the presence of subjects that are themselves optionally accessible to the operation. Niuean lacks any form of scrambling and is rigidly VSO, so that at first glance, that attract closest is not at work. In this paper, we argue that Niuean’s challenge to universal principles is only apparent, and that the traditional attract closest condition is indeed in force in Niuean. First, we show that the availability of object-to-subject raising reflects a wider subject/object parity whereby subjects and objects appear to be equally accessible to higher probes in general. Then, we argue that this typologically uncommon equal-accessibility follows from the convergence of several oth- erwise independently attested operations: (i) object shift of case-bearing DPs to Spec(vP); (ii) an ergative case system, with case assignment achieved wholly within vP; (iii) an EPP on T triggering V/VP fronting, not DP externalization. The result is that Niuean raising adheres to standard locality constraints as conceived by Chomsky (1995, 2000).',\n",

       "              'The contentious question in the tough-construction literature is whether the surface subject originates in the embedded clause and moves to the matrix subject position (the long-movement analysis) or whether the surface subject is base-generated in the matrix clause and a proxy link is established with the embedded gap, typically via a null operator (the base-generation analysis). In this paper, we subject to closer scrutiny one particularly influential recent argument in favour of the long-movement analysis. Hartman (2011, 2012a,b) discovered that experiencer PPs lead to ungrammaticality in tough-constructions, but not in expletive constructions. He attributes this ungrammaticality to defective intervention of A-movement, a movement step crucially postulated only in the long-movement analysis. He takes this as evidence that tough-constructions are derived via long movement. We make the novel observation that a PP intervention effect analogous to that in tough-constructions also arises in constructions that do not involve A-movement, namely pretty-predicate constructions and gapped degree phrases. Consequently, the intervention effect does not provide an argument for an A-movement step in tough-constructions or for the long-movement analysis, but rather for the base-generation analysis. We develop a uniform account of the intervention effects as a semantic-type mismatch. In particular, we propose that what unifies tough-constructions, pretty-predicate constructions, and gapped degree phrases is that they all have an embedded clause that is a null-operator structure. Introducing an experiencer PP into these constructions creates an irresolvable semantic-type mismatch. As such, we argue for a reassessment of what appears to be a syntactic locality constraint as an incompatibility in the semantic composition.',\n",

Offering original comparative data from a range of predominantly European varieties standard and non-standard, we argue that the distinct interpretation and behaviour of each of the three types of illocutionary complementiser examined necessitates a revision and expansion of the clausal left-edge to incorporate utterance-oriented information within a dedicated domain above the CP.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2 argues that Ibero-Romance vocatives and discourse particles exhibit syntactic behaviour which cannot be accounted for within a clausal architecture whose topmost layer is the CP. Instead, these utterance-oriented items’ behaviour and sentential distribution is indicative of an internally-articulated dedicated utterance field, which we call the Utterance Phrase (UP), above the CP, divisible into a higher, externally-oriented layer and a lower, internally-oriented layer (itself decomposable into dedicated projections for addressee and speaker). The remainder of the dissertation describes and analyses three types of illocutionary complementiser attested in Ibero-Romance, and shows that each item differs from the others not only in interpretation, but also in terms of their formal and distributional properties, and availability across Ibero-Romance dialects. Only one of these complementisers (quotative que, Chapter 4) patterns like a C-head; the other two (exclamative and conjunctive que, in Chapters 3 and 5 respectively) show distinct behaviour which we argue is evidence that they lexicalise separate U-heads within an expanded and revised cartographic left-periphery. The bundling of features on functional heads at the UP/CP boundary —the locus of the split Rizzian ForceP, or Speas & Tenny’s (2003) SentienceP— is unique to European Portuguese, contrasting with feature-scattering (following Giorgi & Pianesi 1997) across projections in other Peninsular Ibero-Romance varieties. This variation in feature distribution is argued to be responsible for microparametric differences in the availability and behaviour of illocutionary complementisers across Ibero-Romance. The compositionality of sentence-typing; fine-grained differences in the specification of complementisers; and gradient judgments on the constructions in which the illocutionary complementisers participate are also accounted for in these terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dissertation proposes that, despite the progressive obsolescence of such items in standard, contemporary European Portuguese, the ubiquity of matrix illocutionary complementisers in European/Peninsular Ibero-Romance is a defining characteristic of this branch of the Romance languages. On the view that their loss in European Portuguese is counterbalanced by verb-based mechanisms for sentence- and illocutionary-typing, Chapter 6 concludes by exploring the possibility that the prevalence of illocutionary complementisers, and other utterance-oriented elements, correlates inversely with verb height.',\n",

       "              'This paper investigates TP-ellipsis with a polarity particle in Spanish, with particular attention to its occurrence in multiple-complementizer clauses (i.e., … que XP que ellipsis licensor ellipsis site). The paper argues for a version of the standard ΣP-account of TP-ellipsis, with the polarity/focal item (e.g., también/tampoco/sí/no) crucially involved in the licensing of ellipsis. It is argued that the XP-que sequence is hosted in TopicP. The XP is a contrastive topic functioning as the remnant of TP-ellipsis and que instantiates recomplementation que –a topic marker. The ellipsis licensor, for its part, sits in a CP-related projection that follows TopicP. In light of the parallelism drawn here between the polarity elements that can partake in the licensing of TP-ellipsis and run-of-the-mill foci, the paper provides a host of arguments from Spanish and related languages underscoring the role of focus in this type of ellipsis operation, which may ultimately lead to the conflation of ΣP and FocusP. Similarly, I explore the relationship established between TopicP (the remnant) and ΣP/FocusP (the ellipsis licensor) in the process of TP-ellipsis as well as offer a principled account of the inability of jussive/optative que to survive ellipsis, unlike recomplementation que. The results of this paper therefore have wide-ranging consequences for the derivation of TP-ellipsis phenomena alongside the delineation of the preverbal field in Spanish and beyond.',\n",

       "              'This research study investigates nunation (Arabic tanwi:n) in Haili Arabic (HA). Haili Arabic is a dialect spoken mainly in Hail, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It argues that the nunation suffix, -n, is used to fill the position of the head in a determiner phrase (i.e. the head Dº position) when the latter is not occupied by the definite article or a personal pronoun. The filling follows from a proposed condition that demands the head Dº position to be filled by an overt element in the Arabic dialect under\\r\\ninvestigation. This accounts for the lack of -n with definite entities (i.e. definite determiner phrases, DPs) headed by the definite article ʔal, on the one hand, and the presence of -n in indefinite entities and proper nouns, on the other. Additionally, to account for the use of -n with adverbs, the current study assumes that adverbs in HA are underlyingly DPs headed by Dº; hence, the demand to fill Dº due to the head Dº condition. With regard to the semantic function of -n, the study argues that the nunation\\r\\nsuffix creates a predicational relation between the noun and the remnant of the DP through forcing the given noun to move to the Specifier position of the associating DP. What forces this movement is the [EDGE] feature, which is part of the featural bundle of the nunation suffix, requiring the edge of a phrase to be filled',\n",

It also examines the Propositional Cleft.  While the Propositional Cleft is acknowledged in Scottish Gaelic grammars, a thorough description and analysis has not been done.  The Propositional Cleft is noteworthy for the presence of cleft morphosyntax--the copula, a pro-form, and the relative complementizer--but the absence of a clefted constituent.  This lack of a clefted constituent is puzzling if the Propositional Cleft is to be included in the cleft paradigm, since it is the clefted constituent which is typically interpreted as the focus, and the interpretation of focus is typically assumed to be derived from the focus-background bipartite structure created by the cleft construction.  This property of lacking a bipartite structure makes the Propositional Cleft, at first glance, an unlikely candidate for membership in the cleft paradigm.  Over the course of the dissertation I describe and analyze the pragmatic effect of the Propositional Cleft, and I argue that the Propositional Cleft is in fact a member of the cleft paradigm, but that it instantiates a typologically rare combination of broad sized identificational focus.  The syntactic and semantic analysis of clefts proposed here extends straightforwardly to derive the particular meaning and structure of the Propositional Cleft, and shows that broad focus is not incompatible with cleft meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI argue that A-bar dependencies in Scottish Gaelic are movement-based, and propose a syntactic account of focus movement in clefts which involves the checking of focus features in C by the movement of the focus phrase to its specifier.  This syntactic account of focus allows us to understand the absence of movement in the Propositional Cleft, since the broad size of focus means that  the focus constituent is the complement of CP, and so can check the focus features of C in situ.',\n",

The remainder nominals are assignated [±fem] in Morphology, through an exhaustivity condition.

       "              'The paper examines directive clauses in Slovenian, where such clauses primarily realize as imperatives and directive subjunctives. Both realizations display restrictions on subject selection: in embedded contexts, the subject of a directive clause cannot be co-referential with the matrix context. This restriction, known as subject obviation, has been previously discussed mostly in relation to subjunctive embedding, and not observed with imperatives. A similar restriction arises with all directive clauses also in matrix contexts, namely: the subject of a matrix directive clause cannot be first person exclusive. I argue that both restrictions are manifestations of the same phenomenon, a generalized subject obviation. I propose that the restriction arises due to a binding restriction which applies between the subject of directive clauses and a perspectival PRO in the specifier of MoodP. I suggest that this PRO is required for the interpretation of a directive operator in Mood and serves as a grammatical representation for the source of the directive speech act realized by directive clauses. As such it is semantically bound by either an expression referring to the speaker, in matrix clauses, or the matrix subject in embedded clauses. The latter is a parallel to subject control constructions. I show that this analysis not only derives the generalized subject obviation effect, but that it also correctly predicts other restrictions that occur with directive clauses, such as the absence of the exclusive first person subject ban in questions. The ban is correctly predicted to apply to second person subjects in questions instead, which explains the cross-linguistic absence of imperatives in matrix questions.',\n",

Traditionally, the effect of weight in Portuguese is seen as categorical, and only word-final syllables are considered to be weight-sensitive—i.e., the weight of penult and antepenult syllables is not relevant for stress. I examine stress placement across a comprehensive lexicon of Portuguese non-verbs (Houaiss et al. 2001), and show that weight effects (i) are also present word-internally and (ii) gradually weaken as we move away from the right edge of the word—this gradience is supported by different Ordinal Regression models. I compare two theories of weight domain, namely, the syllable and the interval (Steriade 2012)— defined as a rhythmic unit that spans from one vowel up to (but not including) the next vowel. Under both theories, weight has a gradient effect on stress, and is not limited to the right edge of the word. The data analysed suggest that intervals may be more accurate representations of the weight domain in Portuguese, in that they appropriately capture onset effects found in the lexicon that are not accounted for under syllable theory. In addition, interval-based models are more accurate than syllable-based models. Finally, I briefly demonstrate how the analysis proposed here can be mapped into a MaxEnt model (Goldwater & Johnson 2003, Wilson 2006, Hayes & Wilson 2008).',\n",

Main evidence for this argument comes from the interaction between syntactic head movement and postsyntactic affixation in the Niger-Congo language Wolof, which confirms an important prediction of this analysis. Namely, if a postsyntactic process can feed a syntactic one, we also expect the postsyntactic process to be bled if the structural conditions for its application are not met, resulting in surface opacity effects. This is precisely what we find in Wolof, where the past tense morpheme 'oon' is postsyntactically affixed onto the verb in a particular structural con- figuration and carried along with it to C, but stranded by the verb below C if the structural requirements for its affixation are not met.\",\n",

The first uses higher-order dynamic generalized quantifiers (GQs), functions whose ‘trace’ is itself typed as a dynamic GQ. Such functions, though a hop-and-a-skip up the type hierarchy from dynamic GQs, are already available to any standard-issue Montagovian dynamic semanticist, and dealing with them compositionally requires nothing beyond whatever machinery already underwrites quantifiers in object position, scope ambiguity, and so on (though the analysis is presented using a handy continuations-oriented tower notation). I build on this theory by exploring a type-theoretic elaboration of it (technically, in terms of subtype polymorphism) that rules out arguably unattested ‘pseudo-cumulative’ readings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, I show that these steps (higher-order dynamic GQs subtyping) are unnecessary if the usual ‘point-wise’ dynamic semantics of Dynamic Predicate Logic or Compositional DRT, where propositions are typed as relations on assignments, is replaced with an update semantics, where propositions are typed as functions from sets of assignments into sets of assignments. Conservative update-semantic meanings for modified numerals — direct analogs of their point-wise counterparts — automatically yield cumulative readings and fail to derive pseudo-cumulative readings. This gives an argument for an update semantics in the anaphoric domain (so far as I know the first of its kind).\\r\\n\\r\\nI compare these two kinds of analyses with each other and consider their relation to post-suppositions in semantic theory more generally, concluding: (i) the theories canvassed here have modest empirical advantages over post-suppositions; (ii) the update-theoretic account offers the most direct route to an empirically adequate analysis of modified numerals; (iii) the reasons for this turn out to be specific to modified numerals; theories of other ‘post-suppositional’ phenomena are better formulated with higher-order GQs.',\n",

       "              'This paper proposes to investigate the syntax and semantics of \"nanak\" in Squliq Atayal in a cross-linguistic context: When construed as an adverbial, \"nanak\" very often gets a focus reading, akin to only in English, and its distribution is relatively free. By contrast, when attached to an argument, \"nanak\" has a much restricted distribution, and its reading is distinctively reflexive. Interestingly, there is also a grey area in-between the two construals, where \"nanak\" occupies an adjunct position, though interpreted with a variety of reflexive readings. Our inquiry is thus two-fold: The first part is to deal with the issue whether there is a conceptual connection between only and self, especially in view of a strong resemblance from Chinese \"ziji\" ‘self’, which behaves much like an intensifier before negation, while serving as a reflexive adverbial after negation. The second part is to find an interpretive procedure which aims to capture the generalization behind various construals of \"nanak\" and \"ziji\". In this paper, we propose to build upon Horn’s (1969) classic analysis of \"only\", and characterize reflexive adverbials as focus operators involving negation over an alternative set. Depending on the locus of the self-operator, it may be related to either a predicate or a peripheral argument role (cause, instrument, comitant, etc). This explains away the spectrum of ‘selfhood’ readings across Squliq Atayal and Mandarin Chinese, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of how contrastivity interacts with reflexivity in natural languages.',\n",

Clitic second and V-2 do, however, share some prosodic characteristics, which is taken to indicate that the two should be unified at least to some extent prosodically (with clitic second, the second position is in fact defined prosodically: clitics are second within their intonational phrase), which also simplifies the syntax of V-2. From this perspective, the paper gives accounts of a number of properties of V-2, like the root/embedded clause asymmetry regarding the productivity of V-2, the non-pickiness of the V-2 requirement (where just about anything can satisfy it), and the role of the freedom of word order in the development of syntactic V-2, where all these are ultimately traced to the presence of a prosodic requirement.

This operation can be analyzed as an overt instantiation of the 'monstrous' mechanism of 'context shift' postulated for attitude reports in some spoken languages (Schlenker 2003, Anand and Nevins 2004, Anand 2006, Quer 2005). For Attitude Role Shift, we argue that this analysis brings new light to the typology of context-shifting operations: while some sign languages make it possible to 'mix perspectives' under Role Shift (Quer 2005), we argue that ASL and LSF obey the constraint that indexicals should 'shift together' (Anand 2006). Still, in ASL and LSF, data from Attitude Role Shift alone cannot fully exclude an alternative analysis based on quotation without context shift. By contrast, Action Role Shift, which has no known counterpart in spoken language, is not amenable to a quotational analysis because it is used to describe actions that don't involve any speech- or thought-acts; in that respect, the context-shifting operations we find in sign language are 'super monsters' that can shift the context outside of attitude reports. We develop a context-shifting analysis that applies both to Attitude and to Action Role Shift.

       "              'This monograph investigates the temporal interpretation of narrative discourse in two parts. The theme of the first part is narrative progression. It begins with a case study of the adverb ‘now’ and its interaction with the meaning of tense. The case study motivates an ontological distinction between events, states and times and proposes that ‘now’ seeks a prominent state that holds throughout the time described by the tense. Building on prior research, prominence is shown to be influenced by principles of discourse coherence and two coherence principles, NARRATION and RESULT, are given a formally explicit characterization. The key innovation is a new method for testing the definitional adequacy of NARRATION and RESULT, namely by an abductive argument. This contribution opens a new way of thinking about how eventive and stative descriptions contribute to the perceived narrative progression in a discourse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme of the second part of the monograph is the semantics and pragmatics of tense. A key innovation is that the present and past tenses are treated as scalar alternatives, a view that is motivated by adopting a particular hypothesis concerning stative predication. The proposed analysis accounts for tense in both matrix clauses and in complements of propositional attitudes, where the notorious double access reading arises. This reading is explored as part of a corpus study that provides a glimpse of how tense semantics interacts with Gricean principles and at-issueness. Several cross-linguistic predictions of the analysis are considered, including their consequences for the Sequence of Tense phenomenon and the Upper Limit Constraint. Finally, a hypothesis is provided about how tense meanings compose with temporal adverbs and verb phrases. Two influential analysis of viewpoint aspect are then compared in light of the hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monograph is directed at graduate students and researchers in semantics, pragmatics and philosophy of language. The analysis of narrative discourse that is developed in the monograph synthesizes and builds on prior collaborative research with Corien Bary, Valentine Hacquard, Thomas Roberts, Roger Schwarzschild, Una Stojnić, Károly Varasdi and Aaron White.',\n",

Under this analysis, a problem arises when one considers that the most canonical verbal idioms contain a DP-object. Given that DPs are also claimed to be phases, the question arises of why verbal idioms can straddle the DP- but not the vP-phase boundary. Our solution to this problem is twofold. We show first of all that not all idioms are actually confined to a single phase: whilst idiomatic phrases are restricted to the vP-phase, idiomatically combing expressions are not. Hence, the DP-phase problem is only relevant for idiomatic phrases. Secondly, we propose that in these instances the determiner, which does not contribute referentiality to the object, actually does not project.

We focus in particular on verbs. Using a corpus analysis, we first show that the distribution of syntactic structures and lexical items that a verb occurs with is more complex in some contexts (meal contexts) than in others (play contexts). This finding raises the question of whether meal contexts have more semantic information than play contexts. We address this question in a large-scale Human Simulation Paradigm experiment, where we show that the relationship between distributional complexity and semantic information is not direct. Rather, nonlinguistic contexts with less distributional complexity (e.g. play contexts) yield better learning when simulated learners have little information, and nonlinguistic contexts with greater distributional complexity (e.g. meal contexts) yield better learning when those learners have more information. Further, simulated learners are only able to take advantage of the information in the higher-complexity contexts if they have access to both syntactic and lexical information, while in contrast, those learners are able to take advantage of the information in the lower-complexity contexts even if they have access to only syntactic information. This provides evidence that `pure' syntactic bootstrapping is most useful in early coarse-grained verb-learning, while later verb-learning combines syntactic and lexical information to fine-tune verbs' semantic representations.

It demonstrates that every possible relationship between definiteness and interpretation is attested. It also demonstrates that agreement mismatches are found with relative readings and with proportional readings, but different kinds of agreement mismatches in each case. One consistent pattern is that a quantity superlative with adverbial morphology and neuter singular agreement features is used with relative superlatives. On the other hand, quantity superlatives with proportional readings always agree in number. I conclude that quantity superlatives are not structurally analogous to quality superlatives on either relative or proportional readings, but they depart from a plain attributive structure in different ways. On relative readings they can be akin to pseudopartitives (as in a cup of tea), while proportional readings are more closely related to partitives (as in a piece of the cake). More specifically, I suggest that the agreement features of a superlative exhibits depend on the domain from which the target is drawn (the target-domain hypothesis). When the target is a degree, as it is with adverbial superlatives and certain relative superlatives, default neuter singular emerges. Definiteness there is driven by the same process that drives definiteness with adverbial superlatives. With proportional readings, the target argument of the superlative is a subpart or subset of the domain indicated by the substance noun, hence number agreement. Subtle aspects of how the comparison class and the superlative marker are construed determine definiteness for proportional readings.',\n",

Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that more than one structural element can be the source of the valued features, and that the structurally higher element tends to be responsible for the semantically informed value (for instance, √ and n in Kramer 2009, see Pesetsky 2013 and Landau 2016 for related configurational analyses). Yet it is far from clear what it means for features to be valued from the ‘context,’ and why the structural height of functional heads should make a difference with respect to whether or not a syntactic feature is going to be semantically interpreted.\\r\\nThis paper brings into the debate new data from Standard Italian and uses it to argue for a novel treatment of semantically interpretable φ-features, specifically gender. \\r\\nThe paper has two parts. The first part presents an explicit Distributed Morphology model of Italian nominal morpho-syntax. I provide evidence that Italian nouns come in three distinct flavors, with one group being lexically specified for gender from the lexicon, and the other two unspecified. I show that type of gender specification has morpho-syntactic consequences. The first part of the paper provides the necessary groundwork for the main theoretical proposal presented in section 2. Section 2 elaborates on recent insights of phase theory (Chomsky 2001, 2008, 2013, Narita 2011) and insights of the formal semantic literature on the interpretation of gender features on pronouns (Heim 2008, Sudo 2012, among others). The section argues for a novel model of feature valuation in the syntax-semantic interface and explores under what circumstances a syntactic feature may be semantically interpretable. I argue that the morphology interface accesses the narrow syntax representation at two different temporal points of the derivation within a phase: the earlier point – technically, Spell-Out – returns a morphological realization that is faithful to feature values present in narrow syntax, while the later point – technically, Transfer – allows for a narrow syntax representation to be enriched by the CI component. Thus, there is no syntactic distinction between interpretable and uninterpretable features: a syntactic feature appears to be interpretable only if it has been licensed by CI. ',\n",

Most generally, the question whether AORs can be located in grammar as such in rule-based fashion (e.g. Cinque 1994) is still unsettled. In the current paper, we largely argue against this view and claim that several of the core data to be explained are preferences based on norms rather than rules. A pragmatic explanation is offered to account for marked or apparently ungrammatical examples. First, we demarcate AORs in the narrow sense against data based on truth-conditional differences, show the sole hard constraint to be found in a distinction between object- and kind-modification, and introduce several of the factors argued to drive AORs in the literature. A large-scale corpus study on German AAN-phrases shows a hierarchy of relative adjectives preceding absolute ones (in the sense of Kennedy and McNally 2005) to reliably predict preferences, while temporariness and weight do not. We then illustrate that norm-based preferences can be overwritten via discourse linking and implement markedness in out-of-the-blue contexts pragmatically based on the M-principle (see Levinson 2000). Speculating that AORs in the narrow sense have their origins in more general cognitive principles, our findings support approaches that locate the better part of AORs outside the realm of core grammar.

The classic approach to numerical interpretation, first articulated by Horn (1972), contends that the basic meaning of | is 'at least three', and that the upper bound it implies arises by way of scalar implicature. More recent approaches argue that the basic meaning of | is 'exactly three', implemented either with a uniqueness condition on existential quantification (Geurts 2006), or with a cardinality operator that limits the size of the individuals being existentially quantified over (Breheny 2008), or with a maximality operator that imposes an upper bound (Kennedy 2015). The goal of this article is to defend a version of the classic account and to argue against the 'exactly' accounts. The case rests on two new sets of arguments. The first set concerns numerical noun phrases that combine with collective predicates, as in |: the classic account makes just the right predictions, as already argued by Koenig (1991), while the 'exactly' accounts overgenerate. The second set pertains to new data involving generically interpreted numerical noun phrases, as in |, which involve quasi-universal quantification over triplets of individuals (Link 1987, 1991). I show that the classic account provides a simple, uniform analysis of the interpretation of numerals across both existential and generic contexts. The 'exactly' accounts are shown to also be able to handle generic cases (by mirroring the classic account), but Kennedy's account overgenerates. The conclusion, taking into account the entirety of the data discussed here, is that the classic, scalar implicature approach to numerals is more empirically adequate than all of the 'exactly'-based approaches.\",\n",

       "              'Many have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence.',\n",

Therefore, earlier research has backed the assumption that a NEST is by nature the ideal person to teach English. With a purpose to challenge this assumption, the current study, consisting of two phases, aims to explore in the first phase if there is a meaningful difference between Turkish EFL learners’ perceptions of NESTs and NNESTs on their first encounter with them. The second phase explores whether any changes have occurred in students’ preconceptions regarding NESTs within the course of time. The participants are 120 Turkish monolinguals from a private university. Quantitative data was collected through questionnaires consisting of Likert-scale items in both phases. An interview session was added to the second phase to obtain more in-depth insights into students’ perceptions. The findings of the first phase showed that overall, students had neutral perceptions of NESTs and NNESTs. However, in the second phase, the data analysed via qualitative content analysis demonstrated that students’ perceptions were found to have positively changed for NESTs, particularly in terms of personality dimension.

Differences in structural size combined with anti-locality are argued to provide a novel perspective on subject-object asymmetries in relative clauses and other related phenomena in English, with a close formal similarity between relativisation and topicalisation emerging as an important result (Chapter 4). We describe and analyse a novel construction involving control into infinitival relatives which offers independent yet complementary insights into the structure of the English C-domain (Chapter 5). We argue that systematic size variation also plays a key role in accounting for the properties of reduced relatives, including their restrictions on auxiliaries and participles, the interpretation of the present/progressive participle and the subject restriction, whilst evidence from high adverbs indicates close similarities between the clausal and clause-medial left peripheries (Chapter 6).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thesis thus contributes a range of novel observations, generalisations and analyses with both empirical and theoretical implications for the nature of variation both within and across languages.\\r\\n',\n",

In this paper, a variety of known and novel data points are argued to indicate that both a Neg movement operation as well as an Excluded Middle assumption are necessary to account for the full range data.

Cross-linguistic research has recently implied the need to reconsider ‘the more interaction, the more acquisition’ model. We are also reminded that structural-linguistic measures, such as vocabulary size and mean length of utterance are only one aspect of a child’s communicative competence, but some other skills related to pragmatics and conversation are required for language competence. The present study investigates the development of conversational and socio-pragmatic strategies in child discourse from a functional perspective. We especially focus on the impact of the parental input, and question the role of child’s mother in the development of a child’s conversational skills with particular regard to the question-answer forming, positive and negative reinforcement, the effects of frequency, and length of conversation. Our research aims to establish the relationship between the challenging communicative environment (lengthy conversations, parent-initiated speech, answers-at-hand, avoidance of motherese, etc.) and the development of a child’s communicative competence. Our participants have been selected from 5 families. The group comprises totally 5 mothers and 5 Turkish-speaking children. We classified the families as conservative, conservative-pragmatic or modern-educated, and the children as younger and older. The data has been collected via open-ended interviews, and has been transcribed and tagged for analysis. We have found various patterns in parental input shaping a child’s discourse, and the results revealed a significant difference between the two target groups’ conversational strategies, which is due to the critical age for discourse strategies. While the mother’s attempt to adapt her discourse resulted in self-confidence and freedom to question in children, as well as encouragement in initiating conversation to the older children, discouragement from asking questions and from discussing with older individuals had the reverse effect on the older children.',\n",

While LD wh-movement was infrequently observed, wh-scope marking predominantly emerged, possibly because it dispenses with Internal Merge of the wh-phrase pied-piping Q across the clausal boundary. On the other hand, the developing group depended more on silent-scope marking, possibly because the wh-expletive might not have been available in their lexicon. Moreover, the advanced group initially displaced the least possible elements containing the wh-phrase when attempting to derive LD wh-movement, while the developing group could not even displace any elements but spelled-out the wh-phrase in situ. Overall, economy conditions in language acquisition turns out to govern the Mongolian-English interlanguage; hence, more economical derivations emerge at the onset as long as they are admissible, not necessarily grammatical.

We conducted a large-scale corpus study in order to discover what these factors have in common. The underlying generalization appears to be processing complexity: a variety of factors that are related to verbal cluster word order, can also be related to the processing complexity of the cluster's context. This implies that one of the word orders might be easier to process --- when processing load is high, speakers will go for the easier option. Therefore, we also discuss which of the two word orders is easier to process.

       "              'According to some version of the predicate theory of names, names denote metalinguistic predicates of a certain type, in a way such that the name Perón as it occurs in the sentence Perón died in 1974 denotes a predicate more less paraphrasable as “being called Perón” (Burge 1973, Elbourne 2005, Matushansky 2008 and Fara 2011, among others). The metalinguistic theory of names is claimed as being superior in non-trivial ways to direct reference theories, according to which names contribute an individual without the mediation of descriptions (Kripke 1980). The alleged triumph of predicativism is that by assuming the “being called N” property as basic, both referential and non-referential uses of names can be given a uniform semantic analysis. The referentialist needs instead to resort to homonymy or semantic ambiguity. The goal of this paper is to show that the uniformity argument does not hold and that the adduced linguistic evidence cannot lead to any meta-semantic consideration. Polysemy in the realm of names is exactly what is expected under the assumption that grammatical categories and the associated meanings that they are supposed to encode are not grammatical primitives, but epiphenomena that result from the particular way in which syntax combines functional material and lexical Roots. Before syntax, lexical Roots have no detectable meanings; they only point to a Polysemy Space that it is distinguished by means of syntax. So, under this account, which I call the allosemy view (Marantz 2013), there are no names before syntax, as there are no nouns, verbs or adjectives. Names are thus seen as the result of a particular syntactic configuration whose semantic realization is that of contributing an individual. Metalinguistic uses of names, and other derived uses, are involved in a different syntactic scheme, one that makes a name Root a predicate of a certain type. As I will show, the predicativist predicament is based on a misconception of how lexical Roots are identified in linguistic theory. The uniformity argument vanishes under the umbrella of the allosemy theory. Under closer inspection, the linguistic evidence point, instead, in favor of referentialism, as already argued by Longobardi (1994). Following his and others insights, I will provide new empirical arguments coming from the syntax of Spanish names in favor of the hypothesis that derived uses of names require some sort of syntactic transformation (Chomsky 1965). The semantic effects of derived uses of names would follow from the meaningless character of name Roots and certain particular processes of deferred interpretation (Nunberg 1004, Jeshion 2015).

The proposal extends recent work on iconicity in sign languages by Davidson (2015), whose demonstration-based framework provides a formal foundation for the semantics of ideophones that captures the difference between descriptive meaning and depictive meaning, the kind of meaning ideophones traffic in. After providing a demonstration-based account of the basic ideophone construction in the Mayan language Tseltal, the paper then shows how the demonstration-based account can be used to analyze pluractionality in the ideophone domain. In particular, through case studies on Tseltal and Upper Necaxa Totonanc (Totonacan), I show that there are two previously unrecognized types of ideophonic pluractionality, and that their properties support the demonstration- based account. The first, which I call “demonstration-external pluractionality”, involves a speaker using an ideophone to do a plurality of demonstrations that characterize a plurality of events. The second kind of ideophonic pluractionality, which I call a “demonstration-internal pluractionality”, is much more similar to pluractionality in the verbal domain, and involves special morphology that derives ideophone stems that can only be used to demonstrate plural events. Finally, I use the contrast between these two types of pluractionality in the ideophone domain to clarify the line between the iconic and non-iconic aspects of the semantics of ideophones.',\n",

This paper argues for an approach where phases define spell-out domains, which means that what is sent to spell-out is the phase itself. Several arguments to this effect are presented regarding syntax-phonology interaction (in particular, encliticization in Bulgarian and Arabic, stress assignment in German and English, raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Abruzzese, and tone sandhi in Taiwanese), as well as more theoretical issues such as labeling. The assumption, however, has significant consequences for successive-cyclic movement. If phases are sent to spell-out and what is sent to spell-out is inaccessible to the syntax, successive-cyclic movement cannot target phases.

It is shown that the strong ineffability effects that this type of mismatches produce can be better accounted for by a radical lexical/syntactic identity condition on ellipsis. The theory is formulated in terms of a formal subset identity condition. Such a theory, supplemented with a licensing ingredient that incorporates contextual restrictions for ellipsis sites, provides also a plausible answer to well-known arguments against syntactic identity (e.g., inflectional asymmetries, and tolerable vehicle change effects). Finally, I compare this syntactic approach to ellipsis with the weaker syntactic view recently proposed by Thoms (2015) and show that a syntactic theory of the identity condition that dispenses entirely with any reference to semantic notions seems to be empirically more adequate in the realm of certain particular instances of Bias Vehicle Change.',\n",

This definition provides for a capability to isolate a true island effect while controlling for two complexity factors that potentially interfere in speakers’ evaluation of the relevant sentences: the length of the respective movement dependency and the presence of an island structure itself. We found that 1) Slovenian speakers do judge the wh-island sentences worse than the respective controls, but the observed degradation cannot be attributed to a true island effect; 2) subject extraction out of a wh-island leads to a so called reverse island effect whereby the acceptability is higher than expected even if the above two complexity factors are taken into consideration; and 3) speakers are sensitive to the subject island effect, as predicted by the mainstream theories of syntactic locality.

I argue for a PF-merger+copy-and-delete approach à la Miyoshi (2002). On this view, imperatives involve an affixal null F head that must merge with a PF-adjacent host. The main virtue of this analysis is that it allows for a uniform syntactic treatment of the relevant construction in the two dialects, the difference between the two varieties reducing to PF considerations.

The significant point the study advocates is that such valuation occurs while the entity expressing contrastive topic is in situ, through a probe-goal configuration (Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2008).

The puzzle is this. A sentence like (i) \"You\\'re allowed to draw at most 3 cards\" has a so-called \"authoritative reading\", characterized by two kinds of inferences: an upper-bound (UB) inference, viz. that you\\'re not allowed to draw more than 3 cards, and a free-choice (FC) inference, viz. that you\\'re allowed to draw any number of cards in the range [0,3]. On standard assumptions about the meanings of \"allow\" and \"at most 3\", however, a surface-scope analysis predicts only a weak literal meaning, from which neither an UB nor a FC inference logically follows. What\\'s more, \"at least n\" does not give rise to an analogous authoritative reading: (ii) \"You\\'re allowed to draw at least 3 cards\" cannot be used to convey that you\\'re allowed to draw 3 or more cards, with FC in the range [3, ...], and a lower bound that prohibits drawing 2 cards or fewer. The puzzle, then, has two parts: Why does (i) have an upper-bounded authoritative reading, and why does (ii) not have an analogous lower-bounded authoritative reading? We present new data that broaden the scope of the puzzle and that, we argue, challenge the decompositional, split-scope solution articulated in Penka 2014.

Schlenker (2012: sections 3 and 4) objects that contextual Blindness is too strong an assumption because of the contextually ordered alternatives documented in Hirschberg (1991). He thus submits that the computation of scalar implicatures is not blind but just contextually “short-sighted”: it can ignore certain pieces of common knowledge, but it is not required to ignore all of it. In this paper, I show that Schlenker’s proposal is a technical mistake: Short-sightedness is provably equivalent to Blindness under natural assumptions on the set of scalar alter- natives. Short-sightedness thus provides no new ammunitions against Hirschberg’s challenge. I then take a closer look at the challenge, through some initial evidence that contextually ordered alternatives are restricted and dependent on specific lexical choices. I conjecture that these choices share the property of introducing more logical structure than meets the eye, thus possibly providing the logical ordering required by Blindness (or the equivalent Short-sightedness). If this conjecture turns out to be correct, contextual ordering is never relevant to scalar implicatures, as indeed predicted by Blindness (or the equivalent Short-sightedness).',\n",

Assuming compositionality, this means that (i) and (ii) differ in meaning, which implies that the meaning of a sentential clause cannot be identified with its truth conditions. We show that our data have a clear explanation in inquisitive semantics: in a conditional antecedent, (i) introduces two distinct assumptions, while (ii) introduces only one.

Specifically, I present two case studies: sentences with “only” and sentences with the Rise-Fall-Rise contour (RFR, Jackendoff 1972).\\r\\n     Case study 1 investigates a long-standing puzzle concerning the acquisition of “only.” Since Crain et al.(1994), many studies report children display difficulties understanding sentences with pre-subject “only” while having no difficulty with pre-verbal “only.” The current study manipulates the levels of QAC to study the puzzle. The results show that QAC plays a significant role in the asymmetry between Subject-only vs. VP-only, and more generally, both children and adults are sensitive to QAC, with congruence facilitating processing, and incongruence interfering with processing. We conclude that the cost of the accommodation of a sub-question to obey QAC is different for Subject-only and VP-only. I propose that the way information is packaged makes it easier to accommodate a set of questions asking about the object of the sentence, which makes it easier to process VP-only. \\r\\n     We also showed that the extent to which QAC influences comprehension is different for children and adults. For children, QAC has a stronger influence than the syntactic condition on only. For adults, the syntactic condition is not violated. We suggest that the status of the syntactic condition regarding only is a factor that distinguishes children from adults in the processing of only.\\r\\n     Case study 2 investigates whether children can construe the inverse scope interpretation, which children are reported to disfavor (Musolino 1998), with the RFR prosody, which is standardly taken to require inverse scope. The results show that both children and adults are sensitive to RFR and able to compute the implicature associated with RFR to disambiguate the inverse scope interpretation.\\r\\n     As in the “only” study, QAC levels varied in the RFR experiment. However, the results revealed no effect of question type. This leaves an important open question: why QAC seems more active in children in determining the associate of only than in the determination of quantifier scope when the prosody makes the scope clear.',\n",

The paper both evaluates the general strategies behind each theory and demonstrates how to compare different types of theories (in particular, the presuppositional theory and the syntactic theory) by discussing a detailed case study: namely the distribution of quantifiers with respect to the mass-count distinction. In this case study, the syntactic explanation fairs better than the semantic and pragmatic approaches to the problem. Even thought the syntactic theory ends up providing the best explanation of the facts, it is important to note that the syntactic theory developed in this paper would not have been possible without the insights gained from the attempted pragmatic and semantic explanations.

Three behavioral experiments aimed at quantifying the relationship between PAV semantic properties and PAV syntactic distribution are reported. Experiment 1 gathers a measure of PAV syntactic distributions using an acceptability judgment task. Experiments 2 and 3 gather measures of semantic similarity between those same PAVs using a generalized semantic discrimination (triad or “odd man out”) task and an ordinal (likert) scale task, respectively. Two kinds of analyses are conducted on the data from these experiments. The first compares both the acceptability judgments and the semantic similarity judgments to classifications of PAVs derived from traditional distributional analysis. The second compares the acceptability judgments to the semantic similarity judgments directly. Through these comparisons, we show that there is quite fine-grained information about PAV semantics in PAV syntactic distributions—whether one considers the sorts of discrete qualitative classifications that linguists traditionally work with or the sorts of continuous quantitative classifications that can be derived experimentally.',\n",

The shared insight behind these models is that languages with prosodic focus marking assign prosodic prominence only within elements which constitute material critical for successful interpretation. We first take care to distinguish the information-structural notion of (contrastive) focus from an ontologically distinct notion of givenness marking, and then outline the core properties of focus. We then introduce a signaling game between a speaker and hearer in which the goal is to transmit semantic content with the smallest signal possible. We apply the Iterated Best Response (IBR) method of Franke (2011) to find equilibrium strategies in this game, where a unique equilibrium strategy in this case picks out the “critical information” of an utterance, which by hypothesis constitutes its focus. We show that iterating this game at different syntactic levels of a sentence makes correct predictions about the role of contrast in determining stress within words and phrases, and can be extended to account for association and second occurrence focus effects.',\n",

We argue that they have a crucial role to play in the foundations of semantics, for two reasons. First, in some cases sign languages provide overt evidence on crucial aspects of the Logical Form of sentences,  onces that are only inferred indirectly in spoken language. For instance, sign language 'loci', which are positions in signing space that can arguably realize logical variables; they make it possible to revisit foundational debates about the syntactic reality of variables, mechanisms of temporal and modal anaphora, and the existence of dynamic binding. Another example pertains to mechanisms of 'context shift', which were postulated on the basis of indirect evidence in spoken language, but which are arguably realized overtly in sign language. Second, along one dimension sign languages are strictly more expressive than spoken languages because iconic phenomena can be found at their logical core. This applies to loci themselves, which may simultaneously be logical variables and simplified pictures of what they denote; and context shift comes with some iconic requirements as well.  As a result, the semantic system of spoken languages can in some respects be seen as a 'degenerate' version of the richer semantics found in sign languages. Two conclusions could be drawn from this observation. One is that the full extent of Universal Semantics can only be studied in sign language. An alternative possibility is that spoken languages have comparable expressive mechanisms, but only when co-speech gestures are taken into account.

I will henceforth reserve the term “reflexivity” for this type of relation. Like cases of reflexivity in many languages (see Reinhart and Reuland, 1993; Jayaseelan, 1997; Reuland, 2001b, 2011, for an overview), this dependency is distinguished from other cases of anaphora in the language by being specially marked. This in turn suggests that reflexivity is special and requires recourse to additional grammatical devices than do standard cases of anaphora where the antecedent and anaphor are not co-arguments. Of particular importance here will be the structural interaction between grammatical perspective, represented along the mental and/or spatio-temporal dimensions in a syntactic perspectival phrase or PerspP (Sundaresan, 2012) and reflexivity.',\n",

But AGREE is obviously less constrained than Spec-Head, so it is worth asking whether this weakening of the theory is unavoidable. Alas, my conclusion will be that it is. But matters may yet get worse. For it may be that a theory with AGREE as the sole mechanism for agreement is inadequate to deal with cross-linguistic variation—Spec-Head might yet be needed as a second option.\\r\\n\\tI focus on two phenomena where AGREE has frequently been employed: English existential 'there'-constructions and Icelandic long-distance number agreement in the presence of a quirky subject.

[2] What information is shared between the syntactic and phonological modules of natural language grammar? It makes several proposals regarding possible mappings of syntactic structures to surface word order, and the role that phonological information plays in syntactic derivations. It argues that phonological considerations can influence word order by determining the optimal pronunciation of movement copies, and that some syntactic operations are driven by requirements to produce phonologically licit structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first few chapters examine the role of the Phonetic Form (PF) grammar in the linearization of movement copies and in the creation of prosodic structure. It presents an analysis of a puzzling pattern in Bangla (a.k.a. Bengali) that involves variation in the placement of the subordinating complementizer je. It is shown that previous analyses, which rely purely on grammatical or discourse properties, do not adequately account for the pattern. New data on Bangla prosody is presented to argue that variation in complementizer placement is driven by a grounded phonological constraint against the placement of je in the initial position of an Intonational Phrase. This leads to an implementation of the PF component as an Optimality-Theoretic grammar in which phonological and syntactic well-formedness conditions compete to determine the optimal pronunciation of movement copies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the dissertation turns to the accessibility of phonological information to syntactic operations. It proposes the existence of a syntactic operation, Coalescence, which bundles structurally adjacent heads into a single, featurally complex head. This operation derives variation in how category features are realized on heads, as well as certain types of head-adjunction and cliticization. It is argued that the application of Coalescence is properly motivated and constrained by a requirement to eliminate heads that would be deficient in their phonological realization, suggesting that a restricted amount of information about phonological exponence is visible to syntactic operations. The approach is illustrated in analyses of cross-linguistic variation in the realization of positions within the clausal left periphery and the inflectional domain, with a focus on verb second effects and verb movement.',\n",

The two developments that I will look at are both related to the system of clausal complementation. First, whereas Classical Latin typically uses infinitival clauses (so-called AcIs) to express embedded declaratives, these structures are later replaced by finite clauses introduced by a complementizer. The opposite happens in the case of causatives, where a non-finite (infinitival) strategy is innovated. I will develop a proposal which reduces these two changes to a more general change in Latin clause structure, pertaining to the way in which the clausal EPP-requirement is satisfied (along the lines of Danckaert 2017). Throughout, I will assume that the main mechanism needed to account for the observed facts is syntactic reanalysis of the PLD by the language acquiring child.',\n",

Taking a Minimalist perspective, this dissertation shows that the available generative accounts of case in SA are problematic either theoretically or empirically. It is argued that these problems can be overcome using the hybrid dependent case theory of Baker (2015).\\r\\nThis theory makes a distinction between two types of phases. The first is the hard phase, which disallows the materials inside it from being accessed by higher phases. The second is the soft phase, which allows the materials inside it to be accessed by higher phases.\\r\\nThe results of this dissertation indicate that in SA (a) the CP is a hard phase in that noun phrases inside this phase are inaccessible to higher phases for the purpose of case assignment. In contrast, vP is argued to be a soft phase in that the noun phrases inside this phase are still accessible to higher phases for the purposes of case assignment (b) the DP, and the PP are also argued to be hard phases in SA, (c) case assignment in SA follows a hierarchy such that lexical case applies before the dependent case, the dependent case applies before the Agree-based case assignment, the Agree-based case assignment applies before the unmarked/default case assignment, (d) case assignment in SA is determined by a parameter, which allows the dependent case assignment to apply to a noun phrase if it is c-commanded by another noun phrase in the same Spell-Out domain (TP or VP), (e) the rules of dependent case assignment require that the NPs involved have distinct referential indices.\\r\\nThe major conclusion of the dissertation is that the functional head v in SA is a soft phase head, due to its deficient ɸ-specification. That is why it is incapable of establishing an Agree relation with the object and assigning the structural accusative case to it. The structural accusative case on the object is, therefore, always the result of the dependent case mechanism.',\n",

Both singular and plural agreement are able to appear with these collective nouns, which are shown to be morphologically singular but semantically plural. Plural agreement however is systematically more restricted than singular agreement, appearing in a subset of the environments where singular agreement is allowed. Restrictions on plural come from the nature of agreement; semantic agreement features can only enter into agreement when the controller of agreement c-commands the target of agreement, whereas morphologically motivated agreement is not subject to the same structural restriction. This asymmetry between the two types of agreement is shown to arise from the proposal that AGREE (Chomsky 2000, 2001) is distributed over the syntactic and post-syntactic component (Arregi & Nevins 2012).',\n",

While Luganda appears to systematically lack a Vergnaud licensing requirement, Makhuwa more consistently displays evidence in favour of it, as do all of the analytic languages that we survey (Mandarin, Yoruba, Jamaican Creole and Thai).

The empirically observed cycle is as follows. It starts with grammar (a) where only one form X is used both for progressive and imperfective meanings. Then in (b), an optional progressive marker Y is innovated; in (c), Y becomes the obligatory marker for progressive meanings, while X still marks the imperfective. At the final stage (d), old form X dies out altogether, and Y expresses both the imperfective and the progressive. Deo’s original model, though reaching (d) from (a), does not predict that either (b) or (c) is learned by all speakers in the community. This paper improves on that result. I show that it is not possible to get exactly the expected sequence (a)→(b)→(c)→(d), but we can approach it better than the original analysis. The outcomes we get are: (i) (b) is never spoken by all speakers; (ii) (b) and (c) are spoken by all, but (d) is not reached; (iii) all four stages occur, but back-shifts such as (c)→(b) also appear. At the moment, there are no empirical data of sufficient temporal granularity to either support or falsify predictions (ii) and (iii). This highlights the value of explicit evolutionary modeling of meaning change: through evolutionary analysis we show that Deo’s theory of the progressive-imperfective cycle makes a novel and unexpected, but practically testable empirical prediction.',\n",

Exploring the behavior of ethnic slurs in the presence of other regular expressive elements, I show the systematicity of how various expressive items interact with one another. For this purpose, looking at Korean is advantageous since it extensively makes use of expressives across lexical categories. In doing so, I try to answer two main questions that haven’t been taken seriously before. First, the multiple occurrences of identical expressives are known to be possible, but what about co-occurrences of different expressives with varying atti- tudes, including the conflicting ones? Do they freely occur within one utterance? If not, what constrains their compatibility condition and the degree of the compatibility? To solve this puzzle, I investigate the dynamic paradigm of multiple expressives. I propose the Compatibility Condition Model (CCM) and the Compatibility Condition Index (CCI), showing how a language like Korean constrains the possible co-occurrences of various types of expressives such as slurs, epithets, anti-honorifics, intensifiers, or mitigators. Second, how strict is the Compatibility Condition of expressives, and what happens if the condition is flouted? I show how in practice people intentionally flout the Compatibility Condition to achieve various pragmatic effects, presenting four interesting cases: (i) the juxtaposition of opposite attitudes with stronger pragmatic effects such as sarcasm, irony, or hyperbole; (ii) the well-known flip-flop of bipolar emotional index; (iii) the code-switching at Honorific- dimension as a strategy of modulating social distance; and (iv) the question of whether Emotion- and Honorific-dimensions operate autonomously. The result supports the notion of multidimensionality (Potts, 2005 et seq.) and furthermore the newfound hybrid nature of Conditional Autonomy, i.e., autonomy with intercommunication amongst expressive dimensions.',\n",

These empirical properties are shown to follow from the view that an intention report \"a intends p\" denotes true iff \"a\" has a maximally ranked ACTION-RELEVANT or EFFECTIVE PREFERENCE (in the sense of Condoravdi and Lauer 2016) that \"a\" bears the RESPONSIBILITY relation (in the sense of Farkas 1988) to \"p\".

Given this ambiguity, how do learners represent these nouns in their lexicon, and how do these representations change as their knowledge of liaison and the lexicon become more adult-like? To explore this question, we analyze the types of errors children make, in both naturalistic and elicited speech, and how these are affected by input frequency. In doing so, we evaluate two major proposals for how children’s early representations of liaison develop. The first model, couched in a constructionist framework, predicts relatively late mastery of liaison (age 5 or older) and heavy dependence on the contexts in which a particular noun appears in the input. The second model, takes an approach to liaison development which integrates it more closely with general phonological development, and predicts relatively early mastery (by age 3). The results of a corpus study reveal that by age 3 children are correctly producing liaison in the nominal domain and that their production errors are consistent with a phonological model of liaison acquisition. An elicitation task demonstrates that 3-year-olds’ succeed at learning and correctly apply their knowledge of liaison to new nouns following brief exposure, though their productions continue to be influenced by nouns’ input distributions. Taken together, our findings suggest that by age 3 children are well on their way to adult-like representations of liaison. A phonologically-based model, incorporating the effect of distributional context on early errors, provides a better overall fit to the data we present.',\n",

The properties of this nominalization process, including this ambiguity, are accounted for here by appealing to the discrete and surface transparent morphology the language uses to encode components of event (Wilbur 2003, 2010) and argument (Benedicto and Brentari 2004) structure. Nominalizing reduplication is shown to be a process that nominalizes (and reduplicates) only the low portion of verbal structure responsible for encoding the event result (VP-Res). Direct nominalization of this VP-Res constituent yields nominals with result-denoting interpretations. Concrete object-denoting interpretations may arise when the verbal structure contains an argument classifier, evident in the handshape of the verbal predicate. In such cases, the nominal argument introduced by the classifier serves as the input to reduced relative clause formation, yielding a concrete object-denoting interpretation. The interpretive ambiguity is thus reduced to ambiguity in the syntactic structure underlying the derived nominal. This approach falls in line with longstanding structural approaches to nominalization and more recent proposals regarding processes of reduplication (Inkelas and Zoll 2005).\\r\\n',\n",

In contrast, in Romanian, one can note the use of (i) verbal paraphrases such as a face ca ceva să fie roz/ gri/ maro/ portocaliu ‘to make that something should be pink/ gray/ brown/ orange’, and (ii) verbs created with the prefix în- (a înălbi ‘to prefix-white-verbal suffix’- to whiten, a înnegri ‘to prefix-black-verbal suffix’- to blacken, a înroşi ‘to prefix-red-verbal suffix’- to redden, a îngălbeni ‘to prefix-yellow-verbal suffix’, a înverzi ‘to prefix-green-verbal suffix’). Most English colour verbs have the same form as the noun/ adjective they derive from (which is in line with the general observation that English tends to use identical denominal/ deajectival verbs (Hale & Keyser 2002)). Possibly in accordance with Berlin & Kay’s (1973) remark that there is a hierarchy of colours and colour words, the suffix –en in English is used with fundamental colours (red, white, black), while, for the other colours, no suffix is used. In contrast, Romanian uses the prefix în- in almost all cases (but there are exceptions e.g. a roşi ‘to blush’), while using paraphrases with more recent words denoting colours (roz ‘pink’, maro ‘brown’, portocaliu ‘orange’).\\r\\nFrom an aspectual point of view, verbs denoting colour processes are degree achievements (expressing a gradual change of state) (Hay, Kennedy &Levin 1999). They display both telic and atelic properties, combining both with for-phrases and in-phrases (I reddened the wall in 5 minutes, I reddened the wall for an hour). Moreover, they can essentially appear in two structures (an intransitive one: The wall yellowed, and a transitive one: I yellowed the wall). In Romanian, the first structure is expressed with the help of a reflexive clitic (Peretele s-a îngălbenit ‘The wall clitic reflexive-has prefix-yellowed’), while the transitive form is similar to the one in English (Am îngălbenit peretele ‘Have yellowed the wall’).\\r\\nCombining Ramchand’s analysis (2008, 2014) with Brody’s (2000) idea that the intermediary level should be eliminated, I embrace the view that words spell out a span, i.e. a complement sequence of heads (@ indicates where the span spells out, and * the formation of a word with the head immediately below). I discuss a causative and locative meaning of -en and în- for English and Romanian (to redden= to cause to pass in a state of red).',\n",

I propose that Mandarin has a T(ense) projection in its clause structure, which is headed by a phonologically null element ∅yǒu in a non-future episodic sentence. It is optionally pronounced as yǒu when the negation marker méi moves obligatorily out of its base position under Neg(ation) to attach to it in a non-future negative episodic sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence to support this proposal comes from the fact that ∅yǒu (/méiyǒu) demonstrates two major properties of a T(ense) head: the location of the temporal interpretation of a sentence and the divider of interpretation domains for quantifiers, as proposed in Diesing’s (1992) Mapping Hypothesis. Semantic analyses on the temporality of a non-future eventive episodic sentence in Mandarin show that its temporal interpretation is located on ∅yǒu. It is realized as yǒu phonologically, when the negation marker méi undergoes obligatory head movement from Neg to attach to it in a non-future negative episodic sentence. This constitutes the first piece of evidence for the TP proposal for Mandarin. The second piece of evidence comes from the observation that strong or presuppositional quantifiers, which include not only canonical ones such as měigèrén (‘everyone’) but also non-canonical ones such as universal free choice expressions (wúlùn) wh- dōu (‘no matter wh-’) and scalar quantifiers such as (lián)…dōu (‘even’), are interpreted above ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu), whereas weak or existential quantifiers such as yǒurén (‘someone’) or méiyǒurén (‘nobody’) and yǒu/méiyǒu-existential sentences are interpreted below ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu). This property of ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu) is consistent with the role played by T in Diesing’s (1992) Mapping Hypothesis, which says that presuppositional quantifiers are interpreted above T and existential quantifiers are interpreted below it.',\n",

This current change in progress has never been observed before, probably because it is so slow that it is undetectable without the aid of multiple diachronic parsed corpora (treebanks) with time-depths of over 500 years each. In fact, building on insights from Kiparsky (1995), the change may date as far back as the innovation of Proto-Germanic and Proto-Romance relative clauses, as these varieties differentiated from Proto-Indo-European. The study also shows that the unusually slow speed of the change is due to partial specialization of the construction along the dimension of prosodic weight, following the argument made at greater length in Fruehwald & Wallenberg (in prep). Finally, the change is shown to have important consequences for the syntax of extraposition, supporting the adjunction analysis of Culicover & Rochemont (1990). The paper also discusses the implications of Sauerland (2003) analysis of English relative clauses, and while modern English data supports his analysis, the diachronic extraposition data is not yet fine-grained enough to bear on the \"raising\" analysis of relatives in general. This is identified as an important question for further research on this change.',\n",

We argue that the best way to understand this alternation is in terms of their free/bound status. Hence, we propose that despite the fact that the prefixes are always glued to the verb, they actually undergo the same process as Germanic particles.

In the case of number, this never results in a clash. Instead, there will be omnivorous number: the verb shows plural agreement whenever at least one of the feature bundles is specified as plural. By contrast, in the case of person this situation can lead to a clash. This accounts for the impossibility of having a lower nominative with a different person specification than the subject in both Icelandic quirky subject constructions and Dutch clefts. Those cases where a verb does show omnivorous person agreement are the result of language-specific person hierarchies used for resolution.

In this paper we argue that Standard Modern Greek (SMG), a language that encodes location primarily with prepositions, has a set of formal, morphologically complex predicates that consist of an intransitive verbal root and a locative prefix, and behave like locative applicative constructions. We argue that this prefix is a low applicative head, licensing the addition of a LOCATIVE DP argument to the intransitive verbal root. Specifically, this applicative head: (i) case- and theta-licenses the added argument, but being void of phi features, it blocks its cliticization; (ii) is distinct from a homophonous free standing P semantically and syntactically; (iii) is undergoing grammaticalization, as evidenced by the emergence of a novel configuration, in which the locative predicates combine with locative PPs that retrieve semantic and syntactic information of the locative prefix. Our findings show that applicatives may come in various flavors, that a language may use both analytic and synthetic devices to encode location which are not derivationally related, and that lexical/inherent case does not necessarily reduce to a PP structure.',\n",

One claims that the yes-no question particle maps the content proposition of the question, positive or negative, to a set consisting of it and its negation, and the answer  confirms or disconfirms the content proposition. The other claims that the yes-no question contains a polarity variable assigned a value by the answer. It is argued that most yes-no questions in Taiwanese conform to the first theory, while most yes-no questions in English conform to the second. The reason why the answer ‘no’ in Taiwanese has to be supplemented with spelled out sentential material is that the sentence inherited from the question cannot be deleted because it is modified by the answer particle, hence is not identical with its antecedent. In English the inherited sentence is assigned a polarity value by the answer particle. It can thereby be identical, in Merchant’s (2001) sense, with the antecedent sentence, and be deleted.  ',\n",

Modality- specific properties of either sign or speech must instead be attributed to the interaction of the linguistic system with the systems of production and perception. This chapter explores both the modality-independent and the modality-dependent properties of syntactic categorization in sign languages. Categorization of linguistic expressions and the use of categorical properties to determine syntactic distribution and guide syntactic structure building appear to be modality-independent properties of language, as are the broad categorical divisions attested (e.g., lexical vs. functional, noun vs. verb). When the examination turns to fine-grained categorical or sub-categorical distinctions and the actual morpho-syntactic patterns that distinguish these categories within a given language or class of languages, however, certain patterns of modality-dependence do emerge, such as the sign language preference for simultaneous (vs. sequential) structure. Nevertheless, as in other areas of language study, the patterns attested in syntactic categorization in sign languages overlap significantly with those documented in spoken languages. This provides further support for the proposal that the properties of human language are not primarily driven by the modality of transmission but are only secondarily beholden to it.',\n",

The study is driven within\\r\\nthe framework of the Minimalist Program, a theory initiated and developed by Noam Chomsky in the 1990s. On the one hand, the morphological study of adverbs establishes a clear morphological difference between the adverbs classes that exist in this language, while, on the other hand, the syntactic study provides the unmarked positions and the hierarchy of adverbs within a given structure.\\r\\nBased on empirical data, the results of the study show that Shupamem has both pure and derived adverbs. The derivation processes are affixation, adjunction, reduplication and substitution. The syntactic study shows that in Shupamem, adverbs can be right-adjoined or left-adjoined to the verb. It also shows that some adverbs allow movements through focalization and topicalization, (higher class adverbs\\r\\nand post-verbal lower class adverbs), while for others, movements are impossible or constrained (pre-verbal low class adverbs). The results also show that the hierarchy between post-verbal adverbs is highly flexible, given that a locative adverb can come before or after a manner adverb, a temporal adverb, and a degree adverb etc., this order being reversible. Furthermore, following the Ciquean (1999) Fixed Hierarchy Hypothesis, this study provides the hierarchy of adverbs in Shupamem, a hierarchy that remains flexible as far as post-verbal adverbs are concerned.

We argue, based on an investigation of epistemic modals and adverbs in Greek and Italian, that one class of PPIs shows their limited distribution due to their particular presuppositions. We offer a semantic account of epistemic modal adverbs that captures their distribution in patterns typically known as modal concord (see Huitink 2012, 2014), but which we will call 'modal spread'. Modal spread is not usually discussed in the context of positive polarity, but we argue that it is instrumental in revealing an additional argument of modality, namely a function that reflects the speaker's perspective. We show that the perspective is always positive, which is crucial to understanding the novel observation that negative modal adverbs do not exist. We show that by analyzing modal verbs as having a presupposition of positive bias which survives negation, we can capture the fact that both the modal and the adverb scope above negation.\",\n",

At the same time, a wealth of studies has emerged on sign languages, investigating the impact of a different modality (visual vs. auditory) on linguistic systems. These two recent developments taken together raise the following question: is there a gestural counterpart of music, the study of which could shed new light on human cognition? \\r\\nThe hypothesis that this paper investigates, using formal methods, is that there exists a grammar of dance, i.e., cognitive structures underlying the understanding of dance movement, a counterpart of music in the visual modality. Specifically, we ask: what are the primitive elements of dance (cf. phonology)? What are the rules of combination (cf. prosody/morphology/syntax)? What is the meaning of dance if any (cf. semantics)?\\r\\nThe paper is a first attempt to address the first two questions by examining some organizational principles of the mental representation of dance perception. Specifically, the grouping structure of dance is explored in details, based on Gestalt principles and their adaptation to music by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), while other types of hierarchical structures such as metrical structure are briefly discussed.\\r\\nUltimately, the goal is to elaborate a theory of dance cognition, which should shed further light on cognitive systems by distinguishing between general cognitive properties and modality-specific or domain-specific properties.

It is argued that both short-vowel stød and common Danish stød involve the attachment of a laryngeal feature to a prosodic node—specifically the mora. In the case of short-vowel stød that mora lacks segmental content, as it is projected top-down due to local prosodic requirements, not bottom-up by segmental material. I show that this device provides an account of the distribution of short-vowel stød as arising from the interplay of constraints on metrical structure (both lexically stored and computed by the grammar) and the requirement for morae to be featurally licensed. The analysis provides further evidence for the analysis of ‘tonal accents’ and related phenomena in terms of metrical structure rather than lexical tone or laryngeal features, and contributes to our understanding of the relationship between segmental and suprasegmental phonology in Germanic languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally published in Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics 19(3), 221–268, doi:10.1007/s10828-016-9083-8.

In a recent paper, Tzong-Hong Jonah Lin [2015. Tense in Mandarin Chinese sentences. Syntax 18:320–342] argues for the positive view. The argument is based on the premise that Mandarin clauses exhibit finite/nonfinite contrasts and that finiteness is a property of Tense. In this paper, I argue that the contrasts identified by Lin can all be adequately accounted for without appealing to Tense. The primary conclusion then is that there is no positive evidence for Tense in Mandarin. A secondary conclusion is that Mandarin can nonetheless be said to exhibit a finite/nonfinite distinction, but only if ‘finiteness’ is construed broadly as a cluster of properties that enable a clause to stand alone as a syntactically unembedded assertion. Phenomena considered in making this argument include both those discussed by Lin (object fronting, wide scope of object-position quantifiers, and a scopal interaction between modals and aspect) as well as the syntax of subject position and the grammar of control.',\n",

For example, when the classifier -ts’ijty is used with the noun ja’as, it is understood that ja’as denotes a set of bananas, whereas when -tyejk is used, ja’as is understood as denoting a set of banana trees. Critically, it can be demonstrated that this effect on the meaning of the noun is non-local in the sense that it occurs within a syntactic domain that is completely independent of the classifier. Furthermore, there are strong arguments that the meanings of all sortal classifiers like -ts’ijty and -tyejk are essentially the same, namely the cardinality measure function μ#. We hypothesize that there are two possible explanations for the non-local effects of classifiers. One is that the lexical interpretation function is sensitive to non-local syntactic contexts, much like vocabulary insertion rules within Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz, 1993). The other is that there are learned, pragmatic conventions that influence how speakers interpret an implicit context-set variable (Westerstahl, 1985). We discuss evidence from noun phrase ellipsis which favours the latter explanation.',\n",

For this purpose, we conducted an experimental study in which German, French and English adjective-noun/noun-adjective combinations (e.g. Jungtourist, jeune touriste, YOUNG tourist, young TOURist) were tested with respect to how well they were memorized. Using existing nouns (e.g. Architekt, architecte, architect) as a baseline, we found evidence that the German AN constructions under investigation exhibit a memorization advantage in comparison to the French AN/NA constructions. We attribute the effect to the compound status of the German constructions as well as their morphological origin, in contrast to the syntactic source of the French constructions. For the English constructions, we considered stress (YOUNG tourist vs. young TOURist) to be a determining factor, which we hypothesized to interact with semantic compositionality. This interplay was examined in a second study, which revealed that non-compositional structures with initial stress (e.g. HARD shirt) gave rise to compound-like effects in comparison to the phrase-like compositional constructions with non-initial stress (e.g. short BRUSH).

The target group comprises Turkish monolingual preschoolers, 3rd, 5th, and 8th graders. A questionnaire was administered to assess the prototypicality values of the concepts in the superordinate category BODY PART according to different age levels. The selected idioms were ranked based on the prototypicality of component nouns, and were presented in a comprehension test with short stories and pictures. Accuracy and reaction time were the variables taken into account during the analysis. It was found out that the preschoolers and 3rd graders mostly relied on literal meaning, while the older groups had a tendency for figurative meaning. The findings from the participants who are competent in comprehending idioms support a prototypicality effect, whilst showing negative evidence regarding the views that consider idioms frozen, and component words having no impact on idiomatic meaning.',\n",

When they combine with distributive predicates, they intuitively impose a kind of upper bound, whereas when they combine non-distributive predicates, they do not (they sometimes even impose a lower bound). We propose and explore in detail four solutions to this puzzle, each involving some notion of maximality, but differing in the type of maximality involved (\\'standard\\' maximality vs. \\'informativity-based\\' maximality) and in the source of maximality (lexically encoded in the meaning of the numeral modifier vs. non-lexical). While the full range of data we consider do not conclusively favor one theory over the other three, we do argue that overall the evidence (i) goes against the view that modified numerals lexically encode a \\'standard\\' maximality operator, and (ii) suggests the need for a pragmatic blocking mechanism that filters out readings (logical forms) of sentences that are generated by the grammar but intuitively unavailable.',\n",

Northern Paiute reveals something about both these locality conditions. Verb suppletion in the language requires the domain of contextual allomorphy to extend beyond both a maximal projection (Bobaljik 2012) and syntactic sisterhood (Bobaljik and Harley 2013). But the outer limits of this domain remain out of sight, at least in Northern Paiute. Verb suppletion exhibits an intervention effect: the trigger must be the closest possible trigger. In the spirit of Arregi and Nevins (2012), I propose this arises from an adjacency requirement that is relativized to syntactic category.

More recent research has identified a number of extra-phonological motivations for this clitic placement, making a prosodic explanation seem superfluous. The present study addresses the question whether Old Spanish, a clear Tobler–Mussafia language, differs in its prosodic patterns from Modern Spanish, which does not show the Tobler–Mussafia placement any longer. The comparison of the data shows that Old Spanish tolerates more sentence-initial unstressed monosyllables and unstressed pretonic syllables at the sentence beginning than Modern Spanish does, contrary to expectations. Together with the observation that the direction of clitic attachment is rather due to the prosodic context (i.e. the immediate preceding or following prosodic words and potential Phonological Phrase boundaries) than to a fixed directionality parameter, this falsifies the hypothesis that the clitic placement pattern in the TML language Old Spanish is due to specific prosodic patterns.',\n",

       "              'This dissertation is about the basic building blocks that make up words, and how these building blocks interact with the rest of the grammar. The grammar is generally viewed as an inventory of contentful units and the rules governing their combination. One question for linguistic theory is what these units might be like. Are they different for different languages? A second question is how these pieces are put together, and again we ask whether these combinatory processes are the same in different languages. A third question is to ask what we can build. This study concentrates on building verbs, specifically how the grammar builds their structure in a way that then constrains semantic interpretation and phonological pronunciation.\\r\\n|\\r\\nThe empirical domain is the verbal system of Modern Hebrew, where this work attempts to unify our treatment of concatenative and non-concatenative morphology. The hypothesis put forward is that hierarchical syntactic structure, once generated, must be interpreted according to specific locality constraints when transferred to the interfaces with semantics and phonology. At each interface additional calculations take place. These calculations are interface-particular: semantics and phonology are not identical objects of study. Yet the two have in common a locality constraint on calculations that derives directly from the syntactic structure. In addition, individual lexical items (\"roots\") place their own requirements on the meaning and/or the pronunciation. The theory developed here limits this influence of roots to the two interfaces, making the claim that individual roots have no syntactic features. Nevertheless, roots are active at the interfaces in ways that are predictable once the right generalizations are sought out. The phonological form of roots is relevant at the phonology and their lexical semantics is relevant at the semantics: roots have no syntactic features, only interface requirements.\\r\\n|\\r\\nHebrew, being a contemporary Central Semitic language, shows the kind of non-concatenative, \"root-and-pattern\" morphology that is organized around consonantal \"roots\" and prosodic \"templates\", the latter consisting of a prosodic shape, certain vowels and an affix. The account put forward argues that Hebrew roots are abstract lexical elements which combine with discrete syntactic functional heads. The combination, once fed through the phonology of the language, results in morphophonological templates which are not primitives of the system in and of themselves. The architecture defended supports the view of constrained interpretation at the interfaces which lies at the core of this proposal, using non-hierarchical surface forms in order to mount an argument for hierarchical structure.\\r\\n| of the dissertation introduces the issues at hand and the basics of the Hebrew verbal system. It also reviews a number of earlier approaches which help set the stage for the analysis that follows.\\r\\n| develops the syntactic-semantic part of the proposal, defining the syntactic elements needed to derive verbal morphology both for Hebrew and crosslinguistically. It is shown that the different combinations of these elements produce the verbal system of Hebrew in a way that is constrained, in the semantics, by the lexical idiosyncrasies of individual roots.\\r\\n| takes the proposed structures and manipulates them in the phonological component of the grammar. The view of linearization pursued here is shown to make correct predictions. The effect of different classes of roots is highlighted, and the point is made that verbal templates are not holistic morphemes but the spell-out of distinct functional heads.\\r\\n| takes a quantitative approach, surveying previous psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic work on Semitic languages and presenting novel findings from a recent magnetoencephalography experiment. These findings support the claims made in the previous chapters regarding the organization of the system.\\r\\n| considers how the child might acquire this system. Recent developmental findings are surveyed and a novel computational model is discussed. This chapter outlines a model of Semitic acquisition in which the consonantal character of roots is used as a learning cue, leading to acquisition of basic verbal templates and eventually the system as a whole.\\r\\n| concludes, recapitulating the main contributions of this work: derivations in a generative grammar combine rigid grammatical principles with unstructured lexical material. This dissertation defends an explicit view of how such combination takes place.',\n",

In fact, it is not (properly speaking) allomorphy at all - in the sense that there is no selection between different morphs. This forms part of a program that attempts to remove class features from generative grammar. Eradicating noun class features, as is done for this data, allows for a more elegant and minimalist analysis with a clear demarcation between the features of semantic interpretation (e.g. [+fem]) and the features of phonological form (e.g. [+high]). In this way it upholds the architecture of grammar made popular by distributed morphology. In this problematic case study, we see that Afar nominal paradigms are characterized by both the introduction of features/melody and paradigm-specific stress shifts. The proposed re-analysis relies heavily on the notion of catalexis. Using a Strict CV representational model, I propose that nouns in Afar are always trochaic. The tripartite difference in the shape of nominal roots is reduced to what part of the trochee’s dependent CV is filled by melody: both C and V (V-Masc) [ˈbara] ‘night’, only C (C-Masc) [maˈtuk] ‘butter’ or neither (Fem) [ħaˈdo] ‘meat’. The shape of these roots juxtaposed with the shape of the Afar affixes regularly predicts the ‘allomorphy’. The underlying form of the proposed affixes have an unusual structural condition, though one that is predicted by foundational autosegmental principles. These come with both features and skeletal structure unassociated to each other. Consequently, following my proposal, affixation can simultaneously introduce features and induce stress shift in a DM-compatible item-and-arrangement analysis, all the while without recourse to class features.',\n",

In adequate dialogical and pragmatic contexts, the lexical verb (L-verb), the direct object (DO), and VP and vP adjoining adjuncts appear to move to the Specifier position (Spec) of a dedicated Topic Phrase in the left periphery in the sense of Rizzi (1997). This quasi-holistic movement is labelled as Defective Predicate Topicalization (DPT), where all predicate elements, apart from Tense, move overtly to Topic Phrase. Linear order between the L-verb, the DO, and any accompanying adjuncts is assumed, among others, to be evidence supporting this contention. Furthermore, the study argues that DPT is syntactically licensed for its phrasal-movement fashion. Hence, no violation of (head-related) locality principles is involved. ',\n",

The empirical evidence comes (i) from a comparison of the morphosyntactic distribution of the “r” in German and Dutch so-called R-pronouns (locative pronouns) and P-stranding constructions, and (ii) from complex spatial PPs in Colloquial German. Noonan argues that a comparative approach to these closely related Germanic languages warrants the decomposition of function words into parts not traditionally recognised as morphemes. The morphemes making up locative pronouns such as Dutch daar/German da ‘there’, and place adpositions (e.g. German auf, ‘on’) are shown to pronounce different parts of the aforementioned clausal structure. A ramification of the analysis is that P-stranding in Dutch and German is in fact the stranding of a remnant phrase that contains the R-pronoun by a projection containing the preposition.',\n",

To judge the quality of linguistic evidence in this case, it would be beneficial to estimate annotation quality over all instances of a particular construction. I discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of four approaches to this type of evaluation: manual evaluation of the results, manual evaluation of the text, falling back to simpler annotation and searching for particular instances of the construction. Furthermore, I illustrate the approaches using an example from Dutch linguistics, two-verb cluster constructions, and estimate precision and recall for this construction on a large automatically annotated treebank of Dutch. From this, I conclude that a combination of approaches on samples from the treebank can be used to estimate the accuracy of the annotation for the construction of interest.

We question the necessity of [interpretable] and [valued] features for the formulation of Agree. We suggest that more primitive syntactic notions underlie the descriptive label oblique, specifically that of an elementary relator with a part/whole content. Thus the DP embedded under a genitive case/adposition is interpreted as a possessor/whole with respect to a local superordinate DP (the possessum/part). We argue that case/agreement stacking corresponds to the presence of a partial copies of this second argument within the phrasal projection of the relator. In section 2 we apply this analysis to linkers, using Albanian as a case study; we then go on to case/agreement stacking in Punjabi (section 3) and in the Australian languages (e.g. Lardil), which are often taken as the core instantiation of the phenomenon.',\n",

Generalized mixed-effects logistic regression and random forests are used to assess the importance of the variables included.

On the basis of rich empirical data we show that Case Opacity represents a case of defective intervention in agreement as the features of the phases introducing the oblique arguments block the agreement with the verb. Potential counterexamples can be accounted for by assuming that (oblique) clitics, in some languages, do not always move to T, so that the phi-features of the arguments they introduce still intervene and give rise to default agreement (as in Vafsi and some other Western Iranian varieties).

Focusing on the syntactic and especially semantic side, we suggest that these methods could help clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any, do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the 'lexical meaning' of individual calls? (iii) how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve? We address these questions in five case studies pertaining to cercopithecines (Putty-nosed and Blue monkeys, Campbell's monkeys), colobinae (Guereza and King Colobus monkeys), and New World monkeys (Titis). The morphology mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell's -oo) we find a root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call concatenation can be analyzed as conjunction. But a key question concerns the division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context ('world' knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation in the semantics (Campbell's krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of 'urgency', whereby threat-related calls must come early in sequences (another potential case of non-compositionality – Colobus snort-roar sequences – might justify  assigning non-compositional meanings to complex calls, but results are tentative). Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in complex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context. With respect to call evolution, we suggest that the remarkable preservation of call form and function over millions years should make it possible to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, which we illustrate with cercopithecine booms, and with a comparative analysis of Blue monkey and Putty-nosed monkey repertoires.  Throughout, we aim to compare possible theories rather than to fully adjudicate between them, and our claims are correspondingly modest. But we hope that our methods could lay the groundwork for a formal monkey linguistics combining data from primatology with formal techniques from linguistics (from which it does not follow that the calls under study share non-trivial properties, let alone an evolutionary history, with human language).\",\n",

However, in other languages – such as the Tlingit language (Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon) – the cessation inference of past-marked statives cannot be cancelled in the same way. This has lead some to propose that in these latter languages, the cessation inference is semantic, and is lexically encoded into the meaning of the past marker (Leer 1991, Copley 2005). Such a view would, of course, broaden the range of semantic tenses that exist in the world’s languages, to include a sub-category some have dubbed ‘Discontinuous Past’ (Plungian & van der Auwera 2006). Through in-depth investigation of one such putative ‘discontinuous past’ marker in the Tlingit language, I argue that – to the contrary – these morphemes are in their lexical semantics simply (plain) past tenses. On the basis of original field data I show that – while the cessation inferences of Tlingit are different from English-style ‘cessation implicatures’ – they are nevertheless still defeasible, and so non-semantic. I develop a formalized account of the cessation inference in Tlingit, whereby it arises from the optionality of the past-tense marker in question. I argue that this account should be extended to all putative instances of ‘Discontinuous Past’, since it would capture the fact that putative cases of ‘Discontinuous Past’ only ever arise in optional tense languages.',\n",

We propose and motivate Tool Grammar, in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts. \\r\\nWe present and defend empirically transparent and radically penetrating mechanisms for constraining the notion of a human language in support of the primary Chomskyan goal of explaining infinite linguistic creativity from finite resources and rapid child language learning in the context of poverty of stimulus data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguage has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.    Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A vast swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. When syntactic phenomena are understood to be conditioned by linguistic action/intent descriptors, difficult problems yield to straightforward solutions: conflicting intents yield ill-formed sentences. When generalizations are sought at an incorrect and incapable level of representation, unnatural and unnecessarily contrived solutions unavoidably result.  By incorporating intention action directives into linguistic structure building, syntactic problems generally acquire a facilitative pragmatic resolution: much of syntax is transformed into utilitarian cognitive pragmatics.    Important fundamentals of syntax are reducible to a particular form of cognitive pragmatics and syntax is no longer so autonomous a component of linguistic competence.   Much of the Chomskyan Weltanshaung and the resulting theories can be retained and revalidated, but much also is to be gained by refactoring the work product of linguistic science.\\r\\n\\r\\nTG represents a sub-paradigmatic shift in syntactic theory to the extent it can be integrated to the generative program.  Important Chomskyan tenets are revised but significant elements are retained. Poverty of stimulus, universals, ill-formedness, recursiveness, interpretation, generative capacity, filtering, and so forth are reinterpreted in an alternative architecture of linguistic competence.  Our arguments are launched by considering a range of critical issues in theoretical syntax plus a set of difficult unresolved problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl visited the sick woman.\\r\\nThe sick woman was visited by Al.\\r\\nWhat was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.\\r\\n*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is a tip-of-the-iceberg example of issues that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  This paper presents a range of arguments from linguistic and poetic data that action intents are of the essence in a set of syntactic processes.  When the intentions underlying structural decisions are examined, separate from the internals of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, all three maybe simplified, potentially increasing the constraints on what it is to be a human language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operative hypothesess of this paper include whether linguistic rules must include linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has not heretofore been fully examined. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we demonstrate that optimal linguistic theory is inclined toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  We present a set of problems in  linguistic theory that require the dimension of structural intent for fully empircal solutions to emerge given that intentions are undeniable in the epistemology of language.  The absence of this level of representation in syntactic theory is seen to account for difficulties in advancing the theory in linear progress toward more comprehensive coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe conclude that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactitious complexity and undesirably prcludes the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more naturalistic solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax. The inclusion of linguistic intent in generative rules points toward the processes of Merge and Move as the essence of human language synax?',\n",

       "              'Pseudo Relatives (PRs) are finite constructions found in many Romance languages that look superficially like nouns modified by appositive relative clauses but actually describe events. Typically, the tense of the PR must semantically “match” the matrix tense, and this was thought to be obligatory (Radford 1977, Guasti 1988 a.o.). In Moulton and Grillo (2015), we showed that PRs are referential descriptions of present or past events, and we argued that a null Determiner heading the PR is responsible for this referentiality. Simultaneity conditions on direct perception, then, force tense “matching.” There are, however, previously unobserved cases of “mismatch” with present under perfect (see Casalicchio 2015, for other cases of mismatch). This combination also gives rise to direct perception, but it is only available in Italian and not in other languages that have PRs (e.g. French, Spanish, or Greek). In this paper, we argue that such “tense mismatch” (TMM) PRs refer to Event Kinds (Portner 1991, Carlson 2003, Gehrke to appear, and references cited therein). We show that the propositions within TMM-PRs are habituals, and that via a null determiner, the PR as a whole comes to denote an event kind described by the habitual (e.g. Ferreira 2005). We first demonstrate this with TMM-PRs that combine with kind-taking predicates, and then show that TMM-PRs combine with direct perception verbs by Derived Kind Predication (Chierchia 1998), which accounts for various differences in scope and interpretation between “tense matching” PRs (TM-PRs) and TMM-PRs. Finally we argue that the kind-based DP-account explains why Italian allows TMM-PRs but other PR languages do not.',\n",

Although, on the surface, the two elements — both silent, pro-forms and occuring typically in subject position — have a great deal in common, we can discern both distributive and interpretive distinctions once we dig a little deeper. OC PRO yields sloppy readings under vP ellipsis, is obligatorily coreferent with a local antecedent and yields obligatory de se readings in attitude contexts. Little pro may be negatively defined with respect to each of these diagnostics. Distributionally, OC PRO seems universal and is the subject of a prototypically non-finite clause; but pro may be the subject or object of a finite clause and is famously parametrized.  It is probably safe to say that it is standard to take an Inherent approach to this distinction (e.g. Chomsky 1982, Martin 2001, Hornstein 1999, Landau 2004, 2013), with PRO treated as being essentially anaphoric and pro treated as being fundamentally pronominal.

In particular, we will empirically motivate the idea that OC PRO, NOC PRO and pro correspond to distinct interpretations of a single underspecified nominal pro-form, \"UPro\", that arise based on what UPro Agrees with in the course of the derivation and to language-specific rules of realization that then apply.

In contrast to ORom and to the other Romance languages, Modern Romanian [MRom] possesses two definite articles, in complementary distribution (Cornilescu 2004): (i) the suffixal article (-l, -a, -i, -le) attaches to the first noun or prenominal adjective of the DP (băiatul boy.DEF, frumosul băiat beautiful.DEF boy); (ii) the freestanding article \"cel\" occurs when the DP-initial position is occupied by a cardinal or ordinal quantifier (cei trei oameni DEF three men). \"Cel\" also occurs in polydefinite DPs, being preceded by a full definite DP (copilul meu cel cuminte child.DEF my DEF nice), with an information structure related function. \\r\\nTheoretically, we distinguish between nominal ellipsis and substantivization. Nominal ellipsis is a Discourse Grammar phenomenon (Williams 1977, López 2000), which presupposes the PF-deletion of an anaphoric constituent otherwise syntactically present. Substantivization is a lexical process, which presupposes the incorporation of a silent noun (Kayne 2005) with a precise lexical content (e.g. [HUMAN] – bolnavul sick.DEF ‘the sick man’; [COLOUR] – galbenul yellow.DEF ‘the yellow colour’), and is not subject to an anaphoricity condition. MRom strictly distinguishes between nominal ellipsis (with \"cel\") and substantivization (with the suffixal article) (Cornilescu, Nicolae 2012).\\r\\nORom, contrasting to MRom, possesses a single definite article, the suffixal one, which is equally used for licensing nominal ellipsis and for substantivization, like in other Romance languages (French, cf. Sleeman 1996). In the 16th century, the structure [past participle + suffixal article] marking nominal ellipsis is rather frequent; however, it gradually disappears by the 19th century. It has currently survived with a few words (bătuta – name of a dance, spusele ‘the said things’). This change is parallel to the grammaticalization of the article \"cel\", which began in the 17th century (Iordan, Manoliu 1965; Nicolae 2012, 2013), when the structure [past participle + suffixal article] had already become rare; as to nominal ellipsis and substantivization, the two articles gradually specialised their function, eliminating the ambiguity typical of ORom.',\n",

To compare KR theories, we establish quantitative acquisition-based metrics that assess learnability from realistic input data. We conduct a \\r\\nlearnability analysis for three KR theories proposed for metrical phonology and evaluate them on  English, a language that is notoriously irregular with respect to metrical phonology and therefore non-trivial to learn. We find that all three KRs have similar learnability potential, but the proposed English grammars within each theory are not the grammars able to account for the most English child input data, even if the learner has some knowledge of the interaction between English metrical phonology and morphology. This suggests learnability issues exist for the proposed English grammar in all three theories if a learner is attempting to learn a grammar that accounts for as much input data as possible. We discuss ways a learner may still be able to learn the English grammar from English input by incorporating (i) additional useful linguistic knowledge about English metrical phonology interactions and (ii) biases to selectively learn from the input. We additionally discuss which aspects of the proposed English grammars are hurting learnability, observing that small changes in parameter values or constraint-rankings lead to significantly better learnability results.\",\n",

We show that this hypothesis cannot hold true universally, as phi-features trigger agreement in inflecting languages. We show that there is a correlation between presence of agreement and restriction to human reference for null inclusive generic pronouns, based on comparison of a set of languages without agreement (Thai, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Sinhala) with a set of languages with  agreement (Finnish, Brazilian Portuguese, Hebrew, Basque, and Thamil). An explanation in terms of feature architecture is proposed for this correlation. A prediction for generic PRO is discussed and shown to be inconclusive or false.',\n",

First, in some cases sign languages provide overt evidence on crucial aspects of the Logical Form of sentences,  ones that must be inferred indirectly in spoken language (= 'Logical Visibility'). Examples involve loci, which might sometimes be the overt realization of logical variables; and Role Shift, which may be the overt realization of context shift. Second, along one dimension sign languages are strictly more expressive than spoken languages because iconic phenomena can be found at their logical core (= 'Iconicity'). Thus loci may have a depictive component, and Role Shift has iconic effects as well.  From this perspective, spoken language semantics is along some dimensions a 'simplified' version of sign language semantics, one from which the iconic component has been mostly lost.  While one may conclude that the full extent of Universal Semantics can only be studied in sign languages, an alternative is that spoken languages have comparable expressive mechanisms, but only when co-speech gestures are taken into account – hence the need for a precise semantics for gestures as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: a far more detailed presentation can be found in 'Visible Meaning: Sign Language and the Foundations of Semantics', to appear in Theoretical Linguistics.\",\n",

But when a word boundary intervenes, the flap realization is not as consistent, and becomes even more rare across a large boundary such as a clause edge. This pat- tern is common across many processes cross-linguistically – but why are segmental processes at word edges often more variable, and what influences the rate of variability? We propose that phonological variability is only indirectly influenced by syntax and prosody through the locality of production planning (Production Planning Hypothesis, PPH), and test its predictions for English flapping in a corpus study and a production experiment. Previous literature on flapping showed that it is sensitive to syntactic structure (e.g. Kaisse (1985)), and to prosodic structure (e.g. Nespor and Vogel (1986)), but did not explain why it is constrained in this way, nor why these domain effects are variable.

Taking these feature bundles to be sets allows us to apply ideas from set theory to phonology. In this paper, we explore some of the theoretical consequences of using set-theory to represent underspecification. In particular, we discuss the logical possibility that some segments may be fully underspecified and thus are represented by the empty-set.

By comparing sound-symbolic corpora with general lexicon corpora, this study shows that the sound-symbolic lexicons of three Sinitic varieties (Mandarin, Taiwanese Southern Min, Hong Kong Cantonese) are skewed so that the majority of sound-symbolic syllables are in high tone while the general lexicon is not. Building on the idea that gesture and eye movement facilitate word-learning, it is proposed that prosodic demarcation of descriptive and non-arbitrary words is analogous to a gesture in the speech stream which helps the listener (child) pinpoint its referent.

A study which compares definite articles in German and Icelandic supports the findings in Schwarz (2009) that there are two definite articles in natural language and the realization of the Icelandic articles has implications for the theory of suffixation under adjacency (Embick and Noyer 2001). These case studies, in addition to a series of smaller case studies, support the view that an analysis of one linguistic component may only be well-informed if it considers other interacting components as well. My method, to approach a well-defined empirical case, Icelandic nouns, with a precise theoretical framework like Distributed Morphology, yields valuable results. I show how many types of locality constraints interact in the same word and this is pleasing because it shows that the theory is not based on convenient but cross-linguistically isolated data sets.

We first demonstrate that the simplest behavioral assumptions make it challenging to provide lexical specifications for A- and B-calls: B-calls rather clearly have the distribution of general alarm calls; but A-calls are also found in highly heterogeneous contexts (e.g. they are triggered by 'cat in the canopy' and 'raptor on the ground' situations). We discuss two possible solutions to the problem. One posits that entire sequences are endowed with meanings that are not compositionally derived from their individual parts (a related idea was proposed by Arnold and Zuberbühler to analyze pyow-hack sequences in Putty-nosed monkeys). The second analysis combines a very simple compositional analysis with some more sophisticated assumptions about the environmental context in which the calls are used; specifically, we argue that the B-call is a general alarm call, that the A-call is used for serious non-ground threats, and that they are combined by the simplest (conjunctive) rule; but their interaction with the context conspires to make it possible for call sequences to reflect information about predator nature and predator location.\",\n",

The majority of current approaches to VPE are tailored to derive this parallel binding requirement, ruling out mixed readings where one of the VPs involves a bound pronoun and the other a free pronoun in parallel positions. Contrary to this assumption, it is observed that there are cases of VPE where the antecedent VP contains a bound pronoun but the elided VP contains a free E-type pronoun anchored to the quantifier, in violation of parallel binding.

Drawing on evidence from VP-ellipsis and focus constructions in English, I argue against the standard binding theory assumption that reflexives must be interpreted as bound variables only (such as in the binding theory of Chomsky (1981); Reinhart (1983); Büring (2005)). In both of these constructions, strict readings of reflexives are found to be acceptable. Based on this observation, I propose instead that reflexives, like non-reflexive pronouns, can be interpreted either as free variables, coreferential with their antecedents or as bound variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the motivation for coreferential reflexives established, this dissertation explores how Condition A can capture this interpretive option. I expand on a proposal of Sauerland (2013) in which Condition A is built into the compositional semantics as an argument identity presupposition, and that strict readings are analysed as an instance of weakened presupposition projection. I argue that this semantic approach to Condition A and strict readings is more insightful than a syntactic approach, such as Fiengo and May’s (1994) vehicle change analysis, since it is able to link the behaviour of reflexives to the already established empirical phenomenon of weakened projection.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, this dissertation is concerned with the conditions under which presuppositional elements can be absent in focus alternatives. In order for weakened projection to occur, Sauerland (2013) assumes that a presupposition must be purely presuppositional. I present data which are problematic for this assumption and outline a new direction for the conditions under which weakened projection in focus alternatives may proceed, which is based on the relation the presuppositional element bears to the focus-marked phrase.',\n",

The basic idea is that the knowledge representations provided by Universal Grammar enable children to acquire language as reliably as they do because these representations highlight the relevant aspects of the available linguistic data. So, one reasonable evaluation of any theory of representation is how useful it is for acquisition. This means that when we have multiple theories for how knowledge is represented, we can try to evaluate these theoretical options by seeing how children might use them during  acquisition. Computational models of the acquisition process are an effective tool for determining this, since they allow us to incorporate the assumptions of a representation into a cognitively plausible learning scenario and see what happens. We can then identify which representations work for acquisition, and what those representations need to work. This in turn allows us to refine both our theories of how knowledge is represented and how those representations are used by children during acquisition. I discuss two case studies of this approach for representations in metrical stress and syntax, and consider what we learn from this computational acquisition evaluation in each domain.',\n",

Such claims raise questions about the degree to which identity conditions on ellipsis are sensitive to syntax. This paper reviews the literature on non-isomorphic sluices, presents new evidence for such cases, and concludes that identity conditions in sluicing must, at least, be blind to syntactic differences between copular Wh-questions and their non-copular antecedents. An important challenge to such a view comes from case-matching effects in sluicing (Ross 1969). Copular Wh-arguments in sluices, in many languages and contexts, differ in case from their antecedent correlates. Given case-matching, we expect such sluices to be unacceptable. I show that an empirically motivated characterization of case-matching is compatible with a view that allows (non-isomorphic) sluiced copular clauses. In short, abstract Case is irrelevant in sluicing, and instead, morphological case is what matters. In languages that mark case on remnants, case must match with the correlate (e.g., German, Russian, Greek), but in languages that do not (e.g. Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish), abstract Case need not match. One consequence, is that ellipsis of copular clauses is available in many instances, and not others, with cross-linguistic consequences about when and where we expect non-isomorphic copular sluices to be available.',\n",

We propose and motivate Tool Grammar, in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts.  A revision of  the architecture of competence shifting away from the strict centrality of syntax in the can increase the potential for explanatory power in the generative program.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo test the thesis we select from among difficult and vexing problems in syntactic theory. We present and defend empirically transparent and radically penetrating mechanisms for these problems while rigorously constraining the notion of a human language in support of the primary Chomskyan goal of explaining infinite linguistic creativity from finite resources and rapid child language learning in the context of poverty of stimulus data.  We conclude that syntactic theory requires specification of structural intent in order properly to solve a set of the most difficult theoretical challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguage has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.    Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A vast swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. When syntactic phenomena are understood to be conditioned by linguistic action/intent descriptors, difficult problems yield to straightforward solutions: conflicting intents yield ill-formed sentences. When generalizations are sought at an incorrect and incapable level of representation, unnatural and unnecessarily contrived solutions unavoidably result.  By incorporating intention action directives into linguistic structure building, syntactic problems generally acquire a facilitative pragmatic resolution: much of syntax is transformed into utilitarian cognitive pragmatics.    Important fundamentals of syntax are reducible to a particular form of cognitive pragmatics and syntax is no longer so autonomous a component of linguistic competence.   Much of the Chomskyan Weltanshaung and the resulting theories can be retained and revalidated, but much also is to be gained by refactoring the work product of linguistic science.\\r\\n\\r\\nTG represents a sub-paradigmatic shift in syntactic theory to the extent it can be integrated to the generative program.  Important Chomskyan tenets are revised but significant elements are retained. Poverty of stimulus, universals, ill-formedness, recursiveness, interpretation, generative capacity, filtering, and so forth are reinterpreted in an alternative architecture of linguistic competence.  Our arguments are launched by considering a range of critical issues in theoretical syntax plus a set of difficult unresolved problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl visited the sick woman.\\r\\nThe sick woman was visited by Al.\\r\\nWhat was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.\\r\\n*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is a tip-of-the-iceberg example of issues that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  This paper presents a range of arguments from linguistic and poetic data that action intents are of the essence in a set of syntactic processes.  When the intentions underlying structural decisions are examined, separate from the internals of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, all three maybe simplified, potentially increasing the constraints on what it is to be a human language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operative hypotheses of this paper include whether linguistic rules must include linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has not heretofore been fully examined. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we demonstrate that optimal linguistic theory is inclined toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  We present a set of problems in linguistic theory that require the dimension of structural intent for fully empirical solutions to emerge given that intentions are undeniable in the epistemology of language.  The absence of this level of representation in syntactic theory is seen to account for difficulties in advancing the theory in linear progress toward more comprehensive coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe conclude that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactual complexity and undesirably precludes the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more naturalistic solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax. \\r\\n\\r\\n.',\n",

The omitted subjects in the Lindisfarne gloss thus seem to represent a genuine (Northumbrian) Old English syntactic possibility; support for this conclusion is drawn from a new quantitative study of the Gospel of John. The results of the study therefore indicate that a text such as Aldred’s gloss to the Lindisfarne Gospels, despite its glossal nature, can contribute to our understanding of the comparative syntax of Old English dialects if appropriate caution is employed.',\n",

Shona, a Bantu language spoken by about 13 million people in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, allows all three of these types. In this dissertation, I conduct the first in-depth examination of Shona wh-questions, drawing on fifty hours of elicitation with a native speaker consultant to explore the derivational relationships among these strategies.\\r\\n \\r\\nWh-in-situ questions have received a wide variety of treatments in the syntactic literature, ranging from covert or disguised movement to postsyntactic binding of the wh-phrase by a silent question operator. In Bantu languages, wh-in-situ questions are often taken to be derived via a non-movement relation (e.g., Carstens 2005 for Kilega, Diercks 2010 for Lubukusu, Muriungi 2003 for Kîîtharaka, Sabel 2000 for Kikuyu and Duala, Sabel & Zeller 2006 for Zulu, Schneider-Zioga 2007 for Kinande), but alternatives have rarely been considered. I demonstrate how movement-based analyses that have been proposed for wh-in-situ in non-Bantu languages make the wrong predictions for Shona wh-in-situ, which lacks word order permutation, extraction marking, island effects, and intervention effects. These properties provide support for the traditional Bantuist view that the relation between the pronunciation site of an in-situ wh-phrase and its scopal position in the left periphery is not movement; I claim that in Shona it is unselective binding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Bantu languages, including Shona, prohibit wh-phrases from appearing in the canonical preverbal subject position. Wasike (2007) demonstrates that this restriction applies to topicalized non-subjects as well as preverbal subjects. I replicate these results for Shona and argue that they cast doubt on Sabel & Zeller's (2006) attempt to characterize the ban with an appeal to improper movement. I argue instead that restrictions on the distribution of wh-in-situ in Bantu are tied to restrictions on the domain for focus licensing. This claim is further bolstered by an examination of crosslinguistic variation within Bantu with respect to whether the ban on in-situ preverbal wh-subjects applies in embedded clauses. I observe a previously unnoticed generalization: languages that universally ban in-situ preverbal wh-subjects (like Zulu) have immediately after the verb (IAV) focus effects; languages that do allow in-situ preverbal wh-subjects in embedded clauses (like Shona, Lubukusu, and Kîîtharaka) also lack IAV effects.\\r\\n \\r\\nFull wh-movement in Shona gives rise to questions that bear a certain similarity to English wh-questions. However, using a range of diagnostics including extraction marking, island effects, reconstruction effects, and the distribution of temporal modifiers, I argue that what appears to be full wh-movement in Shona actually has a cleft structure: the wh-phrase moves to become the head of a relative clause, which is selected by a copula in the matrix clause. Just as in wh-in-situ, an ex-situ wh-phrase is pronounced lower than its scopal position, and the relation between these two positions is established via unselective binding. Additional evidence for this proposal comes from the sensitivity of partial wh-movement to island boundaries below but not above the pronunciation site of the wh-phrase, a pattern that has been predicted by previous analyses (e.g., Abels 2012, Sabel 2000, Sabel & Zeller 2006) but for which empirical support has been lacking until now. I therefore unify full and partial wh-movement under a single analysis for cleft-based wh-ex-situ that involves a step of relativization (independently needed for relative clauses) and a step of unselective binding (independently needed for wh-in-situ).\",\n",

Wolof exhibits three different A'-extraction effects: morphological marking of the cyclicity of movement, agreement in class between the wh-complementizer and the extracted phrase, and a subject/non-subject asymmetry, akin to the that-trace effect. The analysis developed here aims to show that agreement lies at the center of all A′-extraction effects, and that their surface morpho-syntactic properties can at least partly be understood as resulting from the general mechanisms underlying the operation Agree, such as the presence of particular uninterpretable features and their location. Wolof is particularly suitable for the exploration of not only the morpho-synatax of A'-movement, but also the interaction of various A'-extraction effects. All the aforementioned effects in Wolof surface on C, and their interaction triggers allomorphy of the complementizer. The novelty of the approach advocated in this paper is in maintaining a unified syntax for different types of A′-movement structures, and providing a realizational analysis in the framework of Distributed Morphology, which attributes the surface differences in the CP layer in Wolof to post-syntactic conditions on feature co-occurrence, known to exist in many languages.\",\n",

The auxiliary is in most sentences enclitic on the participle, but in certain contexts it can cliticize on other items as well, located at a distance from it. In these cases, the auxiliary may end up in a position not adjacent to the participle at all, on the left of its normal cliticization site. \\r\\nThe analysis of the contexts allowing this peculiar order sheds light on the syntactic properties of MEA. We show that when the auxiliary is cliticized on something other than the participle, it obligatorily signals that the phrase in question is either a contrastive focus or an interrogative element. We argue that these structures are instances of a very well-known phenomenon concerning word order, namely Verb Second – henceforth V2. V2 is a property of several languages around the world, such as for instance Germanic languages and some Indo-Aryan languages, such as Kashmiri.  We compare MEA with German and English on one side, and Kashmiri on the other, and show that MEA is an intermediate case, realizing properties of both types of languages. In particular, we argue that in MEA, as in Kashmiri, and to a lesser extent in English, V2 is sensitive to the information structure of the sentence, namely to the distinction between given and new information.',\n",

A wide range of work across different traditions converges on the idea that “ergativity” is not a single unitary phenomenon, and is not realized in the same way across different languages. Dixon (1994, 219), for example suggests that “there is no necessary connection between ergative characteristics and any other linguistic feature”, and Johns (2000, 67) writes in a similar vein that there may be “little value in studying ergativity as a thing in itself.” In her recent survey of ergativity, Deal (2015b) suggests that “ergativity is not one but many phenomena.” Nonetheless, certain patterns and correlations emerge, suggesting that while there is certainly diversity, there is also some unity––perhaps motivating the existence of this additional volume on the topic.

In simple cases, an antecedent is associated with a position or 'locus' in signing space, and an anaphoric link is obtained by pointing towards that locus to recover its semantic value. It has been argued that this mechanism is sometimes an overt realization of the device of coindexation in formal syntax and semantics. Summarizing some recent semantic work, we discuss two kinds of insights that sign language research can bring to the foundations of anaphora. First, in some cases the overt nature of indices in sign language makes it possible to bring overt evidence to bear on classic debates in semantics. We consider two: the first concerns the availability of situation-denoting variables in natural language (we argue that pointing signs can be situation-denoting in addition to being object-denoting); the other concerns the availability of binding without c-command (we suggest that sign language provides overt evidence for such a possibility). Second, in some cases sign language pronouns raise new challenges for formal semantics. In a nutshell, the challenge is that loci may simultaneously function as formal variables and as simplified depictions of what they denote – which requires the construction of a formal semantics with iconicity to analyze their properties.\",\n",

The procedure for root identification assumed by those proposals thus involves only pairwise examination of verbal stems, disregarding both stems of other lexical categories and verbal stems outside the transitivity pair.  Relaxation of these constraints, which have no principled basis, reveals that a significant minority of Japanese verb stems in fact display sequences of two transitivity-determining suffixes (yuru- ‘slack (adj.)’, yuru-m- ‘slacken (intr.)’, yuru-m-e- ‘slacken (tr.)’; nezi ‘screw’, nezi-r- ‘twist (tr.)’, nezi-r-e- ‘get twisted’).  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe recognition of sequences of transitivity-determining suffixes allows us to test the hypothesis that those suffixes are syntactic elements by examining how they interact with each other.  When this is done, we find that, in sharp contrast to what is observed with uncontroversially syntactic elements like auxiliary verbs, an outer transitivity suffix must be taken to render an inner one inert for purposes of semantic interpretation and argument structure.  A parallel argument is provided by the interaction of the verbal suffix -m- and the adjectival suffix -si-:  voiding of the properties of the inner element is again observed, along with the added complication that the order in which those two suffixes occur is an idiosyncratic function of the individual root.  A final argument against taking the combination of root and transitivity suffix to be a syntactic construction is the diachronic instability of the putatively compositional interpretation thereof; I consider in particular the case of causative -s-.  In conclusion, I briefly consider the choices available for alternative modes of characterizing the knowledge that speakers have about the semantic and morphological relations among stems.',\n",

Drawing on insights from action theory and importing them into a possible worlds semantics for attitude predicates, I argue that once the causal self-referentiality of intention is taken to account (so that an intention for some outcome is satisfied only if that outcome obtains as a planned consequence of the relevant intention), the interpretive properties of non-control intention reports follow automatically with no appeal to coercion needed.

Two classes of environments are discussed where such restrictions are observed, namely, complements of speech act verbs in their non-agentive uses and complements of nouns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to account for the observed restrictions, this dissertation argues that clausal complements in Russian project a DP-layer and thus are subject to the Case requirement, just like nominal complements.

It is proposed that in apparent “Caseless” positions clausal complements are licensed by a null preposition, which has licensing conditions related to its semantic interpretation (as a two-place relation between a proposition and its “utterer”/“holder”).  As a result, the observed restrictions on clausal complements in Russian follow from the Case requirement of clausal complements coupled with the licensing conditions on the null preposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dissertation is of relevance to researchers working on the syntax and semantic of clausal complements, Case and the grammar of Slavic languages.',\n",

This non-local dependency poses an serious challenge to local derivational bottom-up theories of syntax. We argue that a local solution is possible if the distribution of resumption is reinterpreted in terms of Case attraction and the derivation unfolds top-down. Consequently, the relevant piece of information, the Case of the head noun, is available on the operator so that the choice between gaps and resumptives can be made without recourse to non-local devices. Gap relatives obtain in conﬁgurations where the Case attraction derivation converges while resumptives occur as a repair in derivations where Case attraction leaves a Case-probe unchecked.

Formally, proxy control involves a non-exhaustive obligatory control relation between one set of individuals i and another, f (i), that is discourse-contextually related to it. It thus bears a clear connection to proxy readings reported in the realm of anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Lidz 2004 Reuland and Winter 2009) though the nature of the proxy relationship is fundamentally different in both. We show, furthermore, that the environments that license proxy control are a proper subset of those that license partial control, another non-exhaustive obligatory control dependency. A central question that arises with respect to non-exhaustive control dependencies like partial and proxy control, given that these are discourse-contextually conditioned, is whether their treatment should be relegated entirely to (LF-)semantics or to discourse-pragmatics. Here, we provide novel evidence showing that proxy control can feed phi-agreement on floating quantifiers and secondary predicates in Brazilian Portuguese and Italian to argue that part of the proxy control dependency must be (morpho-)syntactically instantiated. The theoretical implications of these findings are potentially far-reaching. In addition to widening the typology of possible obligatory control dependencies in natural language, proxy control also poses a strong challenge to movement theories of control (e.g. involving a null comitative PP containing the controller in the controlled constituent, as in Boeckx et al. 2010, a.o.). We propose a preliminary analysis of the proxy control facts in terms of Landau (2015b)’s “logophoric” control, suggesting in particular that the mediating perspectival C head in the control complement encodes a species of deontic modal (Mod_deontic): this captures the property that proxy control only obtains in the scope of deontic modality, just as desired.',\n",

Verb classes that exhibit this alternation are typically motion verbs such as caer ‘fall’ and entrar ‘go.in’ and change of state verbs like explotar ‘explode’. \\u200b\\r\\nAccording to De Miguel (1999), aspectual se is accepted by motion unaccusatives such as ir 'go' when they denote the event’s initial endpoint, since the initial endpoint (e.g., the origin) is unspecified. Similarly, a verb such as entrar 'go in' would not allow se because it denotes the event’s terminal endpoint while leaving the initial endpoint unspecified. We claim that the verbs under study exhibit extended syntactic frames in Non-Standard varieties that make them compatible with either theme arguments (see e.g., Harley 2011), interpreted as results of change-of-state roots, or goals in the case of motion (change-of-position) roots. The final composition of verbal root plus complement triggers the interpretation of the resulting structure as a complex achievement rather than a simple achievement, licensing an external Causer, which in Spanish may be syntactically realized as se if the argument is morphologically underspecified. The most salient semantic contrast between a complex and a simple achievement has to do with the interpretation of the event as no longer denoting a mere culmination but rather a full change of state or position.\",\n",

Two edge features are available: [+ Predicational] and [- Predicational]. Only the former forces the adjunct to function as an open predicate and to establish a predication dependency – or a subject-predicate relation – with an element in the matrix clause.

This new methodology enables a more quantitative approach to the study of accents. Studies on spoken dialect data have shown that a combination of representativeness (the difference between pronunciations within the language variety is small) and distinctiveness (the difference between pronunciations inside and outside the variety is large) is a good way to identify characteristic features of a language variety. We applied this method from dialectology to transcriptions of the words from the Speech Accent Archive, while treating L2 English speakers with different L1s as 'varieties'. This yields lists of words that are pronounced characteristically differently in comparison to native accents of English. We discuss English accent characteristics for French, Hungarian and Dutch. We compare the French and Hungarian results to phonological descriptions of those languages to identify the source of the difference. The Dutch results are compared to a Dutch accents judgement study to evaluate the measure. Knowing about these characteristic features of accents has useful applications in teaching L2 learners of English, since potentially difficult sounds or sound combinations can be identified and addressed based on the learner's native language.\",\n",

Whilst the lexical verb in unaccusative existentials can occur in all inflectional forms, the lexical verb in transitive existentials is restricted only to the progressive and passive participial forms. I argue that these facts can be explained if one assumes the lexical verb in English remains in situ and receives its inflection through linear adjacency, and that associates can act as interveners for the purposes of verbal inflection. I claim that the pre-verbal associate in transitive existentials raises to the edge of the progressive aspectual layer and therefore does not intervene for the purposes of progressive and passive inflections, but does so for higher inflections. In unaccusative existential constructions the associate remains in post-verbal position and so does not intervene for any type of inflection. This analysis is shown to have potentially far reaching repercussions cross-linguistically. Finally, I explain the distribution of the English associate by claiming the associate is stranded on the edge of the clause internal phase, and appeal to the dynamic approach to phases to motivate the various positions the associate occupies.',\n",

Syntactic approaches to possessive dative constructions in such languages as Hebrew and German argue for a movement analysis in which the possessor starts out in the possessum DP before moving to a higher position. Semantic approaches to the same phenomenon in German and French, among other languages, analyze possessive dative constructions as instances of anaphoric binding; the dative undergoes first-merge outside the possessum DP and binds a variable in it. The present article documents and analyzes what appear to be instances of possessive dative constructions in Lebanese Arabic.

We claim that possessive modality constructions arise because both possession and necessity express a relation of inclusion between two arguments of the same semantic type: possession involves a relation of inclusion between two <e>-type arguments, while necessity involves inclusion between sets of worlds. Differences between the two arise from their different syntax: possessive | expresses possession via syntactic transitivity, while modals conceal one argument within the modal head. The similarities and differences are captured within a realizational approach to morphology, in which vocabulary items like | are inserted to spell out structures consisting of formal features. The proposal is then extended from |-possession languages, focusing on possessive modality in Hindi-Urdu and Bengali. We argue that the possessive/modal head can be ``applicative-like,'' licensing oblique case on an argument that raises to its specifier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account explains why possessive morphosyntax uniformly is used to express modal necessity, and not other modal meanings: the universal force of elements like | follows from the inclusion relation expressed by possession.

Participants were tested on the well-formedness of BP-like words and the results indicate that approximately one-third were able to use the IPE to make appropriate BP-like judgements.

Its aim is to gather evidence on whether basic word order is predictive of further properties of a language. The languages under investigation are the Finno-Ugric languages Udmurt (as an OV language) and Finnish (as a VO language). Counter to Kayne (1994), Haider proposes that the structure of a sentence with a head-final VP is fundamentally different from that of a sentence with a head-initial VP, e.g., OV languages do not exhibit a VP-shell structure, and they do not employ a TP layer with a structural subject position. Haider's proposed structural differences are said to result in the following empirically testable differences:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) VP: the availability of VP-internal adverbial intervention and scrambling only in OV-VPs;\\r\\n(b) subjects: the lack of certain subject-object asymmetries in OV languages, i.e., lack of the subject condition and lack of superiority effects;\\r\\n(c) V-complexes: the availability of partial predicate fronting only in OV languages; different orderings between selecting and selected verbs; the intervention of non-verbal material between verbs only in VO languages;\\r\\n(d) V-particles: differences in the distribution of resultative phrases and verb particles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUdmurt and Finnish behave in line with Haider's predictions with regard to the status of the subject, with regard to the order of selecting and selected verbs, and with regard to the availability of partial predicate fronting. Moreover, Udmurt allows for adverbial intervention and scrambling, as predicted, whereas the status of these properties in Finnish could not be reliably determined due to obligatory V-to-T. There is also counterevidence to Haider's predictions: Udmurt allows for non-verbal material between verbs, and the distribution of resultative phrases and verb particles is essentially as free as the distribution of adverbial phrases in both Finno-Ugric languages. As such, Haider's theory is not falsified by the data from Udmurt and Finnish (except for his theory on verb particles), but it is also not fully supported by the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaders are welcome to e-mail criticism and suggestions on how to improve the diagnostics and on further possible criteria (e.g., which further properties would follow from the lack of the EPP/SpecTP)!\",\n",

Traditionally, word prosody has been analyzed within disparate models (such as autosegmental theory for tone, metrical theory for stress, and CV, X-slot, or moraic theory for length), meaning that it has not been possible to make clear predictions about how many different prosodic features can be employed in a single language.\\r\\n\\r\\nI present a minimal architecture for word prosodic representations based on a single set of formal elements. A tier of segmental root nodes, or X-slots, bears the binary contrastive features that divide the segmental inventory and represents quantity contrasts through two-to-one linking, while a tier of prosodic root nodes, or \"pi-nodes\", bears the binary features dividing the autosegmental inventory. Features on pi-nodes are used in tone languages with more than one tonal autosegment, but in privative tone languages, the pi-node itself reflects the phonetic realization of the marked member of the tone opposition. The same featureless pi-node is used as an autosegmental marker of accented positions in lexical stress systems, where its language-specific phonetic realization is that of stress: some combination of increased pitch, duration, and intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predictive power of this model is that it restricts systems to a maximum of two independent word prosodic contrasts, since each requires its own tier of root nodes. The pi-tier can represent either tone or accent separately from length on the X-tier, but this leaves no means to represent a third contrast. In certain systems, surface stress may be represented covertly as length on the X-tier with tone represented on the pi-tier, but no mechanism is available to host a third contrast, since the X-tier is already used for stress.',\n",

       "              'Ditransitive predicates select for two internal arguments, and hence minimally entail the participation of three entities in the event described by the verb. Canonical ditranstive verbs include give, show and teach; in each case, the verb requires an Agent (a giver, shower or teacher, respectively), a Theme (the thing given, shown or taught) and a Goal (the recipient, viewer, or student). The property of requiring two internal arguments makes ditransitive verbs syntactically unique. Selection in generative grammar is often modelled as syntactic sisterhood, so ditranstive verbs immediately raise the question of whether a verb might have two sisters, requiring a ternary-branching structure, or whether one of the two internal arguments is not in a sisterhood relation with the verb.\\r\\nAnother important property of English ditransitive constructions is the two syntactic structures associated with them. In the so-called “Double Object Construction”, or DOC, the Goal and Theme both are simple NPs and appear following the verb in the order V-Goal-Theme. In the Dative construction”, the Goal is a PP, rather than an NP, and follows the Theme, in the order V-Theme-to Goal. Many ditransitive verbs allow both structures (e.g. give John a book/give a book to John). Some verbs are restricted to appear only in one or the other (e.g. demonstrate a technique to the class/*demonstrate the class a technique; cost John $20/*cost $20 to John). For verbs which allow both structures, there can be slightly different interpretations available for each. The detailed analysis of these questions has led to considerable progress in generative syntax. For example, the discovery of the hierarchical relationship between the first and second arguments of a ditransitive have been key in motivating the adoption of binary branching and the vP hypothesis. Many outstanding questions remain, however, and the syntactic encoding of ditransitivity continues to inform the development of grammatical theory.',\n",

Comments welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n----\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this paper I take a look at a classic problem in Spanish morphosyntax,\\r\\nnamely the alternation between the forms -se and -ra in the Imperfect Subjunc-\\r\\ntive (Imperfecto de Subjuntivo). Research on this topic has mainly focused on\\r\\nsociolinguistic variation, and has been done almost exclusively with impression-\\r\\nistic data and speaker’s intuitions. I address the problem from a usage-based\\r\\nperspective, using corpus linguistics methods. The main claim is that the choice\\r\\nbetween -se and -ra correlates to a certain extent with morpho-syntactic and\\r\\ndiscourse factors. Through collostructional analysis I also show that there are\\r\\nrepelled and attracted collexemes that distinguish and relate both forms.',\n",

The analysis we propose derives the actual surface order of morphemes in Mari by means of two postsyntactic reordering operations: A lowering operation and a metathesis operation. Evidence for this account comes from a process called Suspended Afﬁxation. This process is known to delete the right edges of non-ﬁnal conjuncts under recoverability. We show however, that Suspended Afﬁxation in Mari does not apply to the right edges of surface orders. Rather, the right edges of an inter-\\r\\nmediate postsyntactic representation are relevant. Thus, the account we present makes a strong argument for a stepwise derivation of the actual surface forms and thus for a strongly derivational architecture of the postsyntactic module.',\n",

In this paper, working in the context of a general model of the inferential relation between synchrony and diachrony in inflectional morphophonology, I compute the predictions for potential change for three analyses of those alternations and show that only one set of predictions is consistent with the ongoing changes evident in a nationwide survey of inflection.  I conclude that the analysis generating the correct predictions is the unique descriptively adequate analysis of the system of alternations in question.  With regard to the explanatory principles governing the choice of that analysis from the set of observationally adequate alternatives, I show that the Japanese case counterexemplifies a wide range of proposals that have been made about the operation of morphophonological analysis and change and propose that the choice of both base forms and rules is due to a principle of Generalized Type Frequency.  Among the general themes of the paper are the grammatical reality of language-specific phonological rules, the relevance of analogical processes to synchronic description and explanation, and the limited role played in morphophonological analysis by global considerations of predictability.

       "              'Focusing to begin with on the Shuri dialect of Okinawan, this paper poses the question of whether Ryukyuan languages display evidence for the analysis of verbal morphology proposed for Japanese by de Chene (2015), an analysis according to which consonant-stem allomorphs are the underlying or default representations of alternating suffixes and regular vowel-stem allomorphs are derived by intervocalic epenthesis of r at verb stem boundary.  It is found that Shuri combines two characteristics that make it particularly revealing as evidence for the r-Epenthesis analysis.  First, with respect to primary vowel-stems, Shuri illustrates the logical endpoint of the changes entailed by that analysis, namely the total assimilation of vowel-stem inflection to the inflectional pattern of r-stems.  Second, because of the creation of secondary vowel stems from historical w-stems and the ongoing nature of the assimilation of those vowel-stems to r-stem inflection, it displays evidence at the same time for r-Epenthesis as a living process that is still being extended.  When we broaden the focus from Shuri to Ryukyuan and to Japonic as a whole, we find that, with regard to the initiation of changes that lead in the direction of assimilation of vowel-stem to r-stem inflection, the area from northern Kyushu to southern Okinawa constitutes a dialect continuum straddling the Japanese-Ryukyuan boundary within which, to a first approximation, those changes are further advanced the further south one proceeds.',\n",

       "              \"In the present study we report two self-paced reading experiments that investigate antecedent retrieval processes in sentence comprehension by contrasting the real-time processing behavior of two different reflexive anaphors in Mandarin Chinese. Previous work (Dillon et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2005; Liu, 2009; Li & Zhou, 2010; cf. Chen et al., 2012) has suggested that comprehenders initially evaluate the fit between the morphologically simple long-distance reflexive 'ziji' and the closest available subject position, only subsequently considering more structurally distant antecedents. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that this locality bias is the result of relatively poor cues to antecedent retrieval associated with the morphologically simple reflexive ziji. This predicts that the locality bias effect should be attenuated for anaphors with richer feature content that may serve as retrieval cues. In Experiment 1, we investigate the processing of ziji and show a strong locality bias for ziji in self-paced reading measures. In Experiment 2, we investigate the processing of the morphologically complex reflexive ta-ziji (lit. s/he-self) in the same structural configurations as Experiment 1. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that ta-ziji is not subject to the same locality bias effects in reading that ziji is. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the relatively impoverished feature content of ziji effectively forces comprehenders to adopt a search strategy to find an appropriate antecedent, resulting in locality bias effects in real-time processing measures. In contrast, relatively feature-rich anaphors like 'ta-ziji' show behavior more consistent with a direct-access antecedent retrieval mechanism, and relatively minimal locality bias effects in reading measures. Our conclusions are in line with other cross-linguistic research that suggests that the morphological features of an anaphoric expression influence how comprehenders retrieve an antecedent from working memory (Jäger et al, 2015).\",\n",

Taking neuter gender in Serbo-Croatian as the absence of gender (Kramer 2009), it is analyzed as a class of nouns which do not morpho-syntactically express the restriction over the unit of counting. In the domain of count nouns, the combination with count semantics yields nouns with non-uniform atomicity. Neuter count nouns are thus argued to be nouns which fail to formally express uniform atomicity, which makes them quantized\\r\\ncounterparts of collective nouns (i.e. quantized, non-uniformly atomic). While the nonuniform atomicity does not affect their singular forms, it is argued that neuter nouns in SC are unable to derive proper plural forms, and that productively derived collective forms are used instead. In other words, all neuter nouns in SC effectively have the status of singulatives – in the sense that they are expressions which refer to singularities and establish contrast in grammatical number with collective rather than with plural forms. A range of puzzling empirical phenomena related to neuter nouns is shown to be straightforwardly resolved by this view of the semantic effects of the absence of gender.\\r\\nThe paper also includes a discussion of Serbo-Croatian collective nouns, showing that their behavior in respect of number agreement triggered on the finite verb and licensing of reciprocal interpretations are determined by whether they are derived from an existing singular base, and whether they remain within its paradigms. Traditional neuter plurals, argued in this paper to be collectives, are shown to pattern in this respect with the collectives braća ‘brother.Coll’ and deca ‘child.Coll’, as they all belong to the paradigm of their singular bases, and as expected they all require plural agreement on the verb and license reciprocal predicates.',\n",

Although it has been more or less standardly assumed that Japanese null arguments are empty pronouns, recent literature has shown that they can be also derived via argument ellipsis based on the fact that they can yield readings that pronouns generally cannot support (Oku 1998; Saito 2007; Takahashi 2008a, b, among others). Most of the literature on argument ellipsis has discussed its availability, paying less attention to the issue under what conditions ellipsis of arguments is possible. This article focuses on this issue. Specifically, building on Abe’s (2009) observation that argument ellipsis is not freely available, I argue that argument ellipsis is locally phase-constrained (cf. Chomsky 2000, 2001, and seq.), developing a particular phase-based approach to argument ellipsis which is shown to have consequences for Abe’s (2009) anti-c-command generalization regarding the availability of argument ellipsis and Takahashi’s (1996a, b) “Antecedent-Contained Deletion” in Japanese.

After it is demonstrated that the ASG holds, it is proposed that the ASG follows from the claim that there is no such thing as inherently case-marked accusatives in Icelandic. The accusative subject constructions under scrutiny in fact involve a silent external argument that distributes like a clitic syntactically and is interpreted like a weather pronoun semantically. The account is explanatory insofar as it involves one stipulation—the presence of a silent clitic—from which the ASG and numerous other syntactic, semantic, and morphological properties of accusative subject constructions follow.

The emergent view holds that language appeared relatively rapidly within the last 100,000 years, possibly due to some minor mutation. The gradualist view postulates stages of \"protolanguage\" that began as a simple system that progressively developed into ever-complex systems until language as we know it emerged. The original protolanguage may have been singing, as Darwin conjectured, or lexical in nature as proposed by a number of linguists. Human language is enormously rich and complex, which makes it difficult to imagine that all the components of it emerged somehow out of the blue in recent evolutionary time, yet there is no evidence for such a system earlier in evolution. The Integration Hypothesis holds that language is an integration of two independently occurring systems in nature that underlie communication. One system, exemplified by the alarm calls of primates, is the Lexical system, which is composed of isolated units of utterance that typically have a specific referent, such as \"leopard,\" \"snake,\" and \"eagle\" as we see in the calls of Vervet monkeys. The Expression system, associated with birdsong, creates patterns without use of lexical items. Each system developed over a long span of time, millions, and possibly hundreds of millions of years. At some point in recent evolutionary time, the two systems, L and E, integrated uniquely in humans to give rise to language, which gives the appearance of rapid emergence.',\n",

       "              'The paper examines syntactic and prosodic constituency within a verbal stem in Czech. Working in the frameworks of Nanosyntax and Strict CV, I argue that syntax to prosody mapping is direct to the extent that prosodic domains correspond to particular syntactic constituents. On the basis of two vocalic alternations, namely vowel zero alternations in verbal prefixes and roots and alternations in vowel length in roots and theme suffixes, I show that the perfective verbal stem represented by a linear string prefix root theme is parsed into three prosodic constituents, [prefix root], [root theme] and [prefix root theme]. These prosodic domains correspond to three syntactic constituents: VP and a lower and higher projection of the theme suffix respectively. The crucial point of the syntactic analysis is that the prefix undergoes phrasal movement: it is generated next to the root in VP and when the theme is added, it moves to its specifier. In the [prefix root] constituent, the vocalization pattern of the prefix is established. The constituents comprising theme suffixes are prosodic domains in which a general rule (called the infinitival template) operates; this rule in effect lengthens underlying long vowels in monosyllabic infinitives.',\n",

Russian, I argue, shows the same contexts of scope fluidity as those in English, but also exhibits a previously unnoticed wide range of contexts where scope is indeed frozen. I propose a theory of scope freezing that relies on a key empirical generalization drawn from the data:  \\r\\nSF Generalization: Scope freezing results when one QP raises over another to a c-commanding position as a result of a single instance of movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing unifying all scopally frozen cases in Russian, I argue, is the presence of overt\\r\\nraising of a structurally lower QP across a higher one.  Scope freezing itself I analyze in terms of a Relation ℜ, established directly between the two QPs as the result of this overt raising operation. Thus unlike previous theories of scope freezing, my account proposes that in scope freezing cases there exists a special relation between the two QPs themselves, similar to that existing between the two QPs in an inversely linked structure, or a binding relation. I propose a possible formalization in the spirit of Stanley and Szabó (2000) and Stanley (2002) whereby nominal restriction of the lower QP is associated with a domain variable bound by the higher QP. This binding relation established due to overt crossing of QPs is what precludes the now structurally lower QP1 to raise past QP2, thus accounting for the relative nature of scope in scope freezing contexts. The SF Generalization, which is shown to be very robust, has important consequences for the Russian VP-internal argument structure debate: it suggests that Russian ditransitives are not a homogeneous group, with one argument always projected higher than the other; instead, they are subdivided into distinct classes. The detailed picture of Russian scope and scope freezing discussed in the thesis has important implications for cross-linguistic investigation of quantifier scope. It suggests that other languages may also have been misclassified into the “scopally-frozen” class.',\n",

Viewpoint aspect is a common determiner of such splits: perfective aspect is often associated with ergative alignment, while imperfective is associated with its absence (Moravcsik, 1978; Silverstein, 1976). Recent work has argued that splits arise from properties of the imperfective that disrupt otherwise-available mechanisms of ergative alignment (Laka, 2006; Coon, 2010, 2013a). This paper argues rather that the perfective can be a source of ergative case, and specifically that ergative alignment in Hindi-Urdu arises from the intersection of two different ways of expressing perfective aspect, each attested independently in other languages. The first is the use of oblique case to mark perfect or perfective subjects, and the second is a morphosyntactic sensitivity to transitivity, a hallmark of auxiliary selection in Germanic and Romance languages. The result is a more unified view of the morphosyntax of perfective aspect, though at the cost of a less unified account of aspectually split ergativity.',\n",

But rather than a subordination structure, I show that clause chaining in Northern Paiute has an underlying coordination structure. I propose that the temporal relations between clauses in a chain arise in part through the compositional interaction of coordination and verbal morphology that conveys relative tense. Because Northern Paiute lacks absolute tense, this can be abstracted over in a coordination structure, just as in an embedded clause in other languages (Ogihara 1994, 1995, 1996). In narratives, this semantics is enriched, I argue, by additional interpretive principles for sentences in discourse, which produce a ‘forward moving’ temporal interpretation (Kamp and Rohrer 1983, Partee 1984, Hinrichs 1986).

Kager (2012) shows that the pathology is an unavoidable prediction of analyses employing contextual lapse constraints (e.g. *ExtLapseR; no 000 strings at the right edge), and argues that the only way to avoid it is to eliminate these constraints in favor of weakly layered feet. I argue instead that systems exhibiting the midpoint pathology are unattested not because the constraints that would generate them are absent from Con, but because the necessary ranking is difficult to learn. This proposal has implications for metrical theory, and phonological theory more generally. If the absence of midpoint systems can be attributed to a learning difficulty, there is no need to eliminate contextual lapse constraints from Con, and Kager's (2012) argument for the necessity of weakly layered feet does not hold. More broadly, these results support the view that typology is shaped and limited by considerations of learnability (Boersma 2003, Alderete 2008, Staubs 2014). When evaluating the factorial typology of a constraint set, it is important to consider not only what is predicted to be a possible language, but also what can be learned reliably.\",\n",

       "              'Much has been written about the unlikelihood of innate, syntax-specific, universal knowledge of language (Universal Grammar) on the grounds that it is biologically implausible, unresponsive to cross-linguistic facts, theoretically inelegant, and implausible and unnecessary from the perspective of language acquisition.  While relevant, much of this discussion fails to address the sorts of facts that generative linguists often take as evidence in favor of the Universal Grammar Hypothesis: subtle, intricate, knowledge about language that speakers implicitly know without being taught.   This paper revisits a few often-cited such cases and argues that, although the facts are sometimes even more complex and subtle than is generally appreciated, appeals to Universal Grammar fail to explain the phenomena.  Instead, such facts are strongly motivated by the functions of the constructions involved.  The following specific cases are discussed: a) the distribution and interpretation of anaphoric one, b) constraints on long-distance dependencies, c) subject-auxiliary inversion, and d) cross-linguistic linking generalizations between semantics and syntax.',\n",

       "              'A certain class of English adjectives known as a-adjectives resists appearing attributively as prenominal modifiers (e.g., ??the afraid boy, ??the asleep man). Boyd & Goldberg (2011) had offered experimental evidence suggesting that the dispreference is learnable on the basis of categorization and statistical preemption: repeatedly witnessing predicative formulations in contexts in which the attributive form would otherwise be appropriate. The present paper addresses Yang (2015)’s counterproposal for how a-adjectives are learned, and his instructive critique of statistical preemption.  The counterproposal is that children receive evidence that a-adjectives behave like locative particles in occurring with certain adverbs such as far and right. However, in an analysis of the 450 million word COCA corpus, the suggested adverbial evidence is virtually non-existent (e.g., *far alive; *straight afraid). In fact, these adverbs occur much more frequently with typical adjectives (e.g., far greater, straight alphabetical). Furthermore, relating a-adjectives to locative particles does not provide evidence of the restriction, because locative particles themselves can appear as prenominal modifiers (the down payment, the outside world). The critique of statistical preemption is based on a 4.3 million word corpus analysis of child directed speech that suggests that children cannot amass the requisite evidence before they are three years old. While we clarify which sorts of data are relevant to statistical preemption, we concur that the required data is relatively sparsely represented in the input. In fact, recent evidence suggests that children are not actually cognizant of the restriction until they are roughly ten years old, an indication that input of an order of magnitude more than 4.3 million words may be required. We conclude that a combination of categorization and statistical preemption is consistent with the available evidence of how the restriction on a-adjectives is learned.',\n",

       "              'The striking parallels across languages in the syntactic expression of “argument structure” broadly construed has led within generative grammar, at least since Generative Semantics, to generative theories that demand a kind of transparent reflection of argument structure in underlying syntactic representations. This trend is reflected in approaches oriented around thematic roles, such as those that adopt some version of UTAH, as well as event-structure oriented approaches like that in Ramchand 2008 in which, in a sense, event structure is underlying syntactic structure. An alternative approach attributes the relative uniformity of the expression of argument structure to the principles that interpret syntactic structure semantically; here, syntax is truly autonomous, with the atoms of syntactic representations and their relations carrying no semantic values. On this alternative approach, we might expect that the same meanings could be expressed by different syntactic structures and that the same syntactic structures might express different meanings.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn this chapter, we present an account of the heads that add participants to events.  Within current theories, these heads are usually identified as voice, appl, and prepositions, as well as little v for some linguists, where the causative little v head might introduce an agent or causer. We will follow Pylkkänen (2008), Harley (2013) and Legate (2014) among others, in arguing that little v does not, by itself, introduce an argument, so our account will focus primarily on the voice, appl, and prepositional heads. We will argue that syntactic heads crucially involved in the interpretation of argument structure – heads like v, voice, p and appl – are subject to contextual allosemy at the semantic interface such that each such head may have a particular range of meanings, including a null (expletive) meaning, depending on the syntactic context. Once syntactic heads are absolved from the necessity of carrying certain features relevant to their interpretation explicitly, when the features are rather computed contextually at the point of semantic interpretation, we can develop a sparse inventory of functional heads for the syntax.

       "              \"Male putty-nosed monkeys have two main alarm calls, pyows and hacks. While pyows have a broad distribution suggestive of a general call, hacks are often indicative of eagles. In a series of articles, Arnold and Zuberbühler showed that putty-nosed monkeys sometimes produce distinct pyow-hack sequences made of a small number of pyows followed by a small number of hacks; and that these are predictive of group movement. Arnold and Zuberbühler claimed that pyow-hack sequences are syntactically combinatorial but not semantically compositional because their meaning can't be derived from the meanings of their component parts. We compare two theories of this phenomenon. One formalizes and modifies the non-compositional theory. The other presents a semantically compositional alternative based on weak meanings for pyow ('general alarm') and hack ('non-ground movement'), combined with pragmatic principles of competition; a crucial one is an 'Urgency Principle' whereby calls that provide information about the nature/location of a threat must come before calls that don't. Semantically, pyow-hack sequences are compatible with any kind of situation involving (moving) aerial predators or (arboreal) movement of the monkeys themselves. But in the former case, hacks provide information about the location of a threat, and hence should appear at the beginning of sequences. As a result, pyow-hack sequences can only be used for non-threat-related situations involving movement, hence a possible inference that they involve group movement. Without adjudicating the debate, we argue that a formal analysis can help clarify competing theories and derive new predictions that might decide between them.\",\n",

       "              'Examining the gender systems in Mainland Scandinavian, I argue that a strict division has to be made between three dimensions of gender: formal gender, semantic gender, and lexical gender. Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, basic to human cognition, and conveyed by pronominal resources. Examples of semantic genders are masculine, feminine, countable, non-countable, animate, and non-animate. Formal gender is – synchronically – phonology and thus syntactically inert. This means that there is no Formal Gender Phrase or the like in the syntactic tree. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which blurs the picture.\\r\\nThe formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but may be used for the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example animate – inanimate. Of particular importance is the idea that neuter is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of number, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. A pragmatic effect is that neuter in such contexts corresponds to non-countability. In adjectival agreement, however, formal gender is more or less ornamental. Agreement on adjectives is a phonological wellformedness criterion, and if no other source to agreement is available, agreement will be in formal gender.\\r\\nDrawing on work done in the 80s (primarily Bosch 1983; 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (3C) and det (3N) are carefully discussed in this study. It is shown that these pronouns can be used as Syn-pronouns, that is for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally common gender or neuter, but also as Ref-pronoun, to make reference to countable or non-countable discourse entities.\\r\\nThe analyses are based on Mainland Scandinavian, but an outlook is made to some related languages.',\n",

(ii) Second, there are cases in which one and the same locus can refer to different individuals, in contradiction with the predictions of the standard theory. Kuhn concludes that sign language loci are an open class of features rather than of variables; and he provides a variable-free treatment of them, although without accounting for their deictic uses. While granting the correctness of Kuhn's Generalization, we offer an alternative in which loci are both features and variables: some loci (in particular deictic ones) obtain their value from an assignment function, and introduce presuppositions on the value of other (covert) variables; but loci are also subject to the same rules of agreement as phi-features, and thus remain uninterpreted in other environments.

Based on previous studies, this paper proposes the following hierarchy for Chinese: AttitudeP1 > AttitudeP2 > Special QuestionP > Illocutionary ForceP > 'Only'-focusP > Sentential.AspectP > TP. These projections host sentence final particles (SFP) or null operators. When the compared projections are both head-final, the syntactic word order reflects the relevant hierarchy; when the compared projections are not uniformly head-final, their scope interaction reflects the order. This study shows that the higher a projection, the more subjective its interpretation and the harder it can be embedded. For instance, being subject-oriented sentential aspects and only-type focus are not directly linked to the speaker’s attitude and therefore, they can be embedded and be interpreted within the subordinate clause. As for the SFPs linked to illocutionary forces, some can be embedded, while others cannot. Special questions and the SFPs expressing the speaker’s mood, interjection and attitude cannot be embedded at all. This fact is regarded as an indirect argument in favor of my proposal.\",\n",

Here we review the basic facts around ergative extraction in Mayan, surveying both those languages which permit it and those which do not, and identify areas of exceptionality and variation. Central to the discussion are `agent focus’ constructions, constructions which permit extraction of the external argument when it is blocked from a canonical transitive clause.

With the VP complementation approach, I assume that a restructur- ing complement contains a syntactically and semantically independent VP. In contrast to the bare VP complementation approach, however, I propose that restructuring complements also involve a voice head (but no embedded subject). Motivation for a voice head in restructuring comes from the subject interpreta- tion of the embedded predicate, German stem allomorphy, and voice marking in several Austronesian languages. This hybrid account has the advantage that argument structure ‘sharing’ only applies to the subject of a restructuring configuration, whereas the remaining argument and event structure properties of the matrix and embedded VPs remain separate, which is supported by cross-linguistic properties pointing to the morphological, syntactic, and semantic independence of the two VPs.

In the French example 'Anne croit qu’on va la lui recommander pour la promotion' (‘Anna thinks that they will recommend her to him for the promotion’), the accusative clitic 'la' (‘her’) in the embedded clause cannot corefer with ‘Anne’ when a dative clitic, 'lui' (‘to him'), co-occurs in the cluster. The only previous account of this constraint (Bhatt and Šimík 2009) attributes this to a binding restriction. Based on new data disentangling binding and logophoricity, we show that the generalization capturing the distribution of clitics clusters in French and Spanish is the following: an accusative clitic cannot be clustered with a dative clitic if the accusative clitic refers to a logophoric center and is read de se. We derive this antilogophoricity effect from perspective conflicts, which we represent as intervention effects in the presence of a single logophoric operator in the relevant domain.

The semantics of the null P plus verb give rise to a central/terminal coincidence relation between the direct object and the complement of P. Moreover, I argue that the null pro moves to Spec,Appl and functions as an indirect object. In this respect, aspectual se is an indirect object reflexive.

The minority vowel-initial pattern, “Attic Reduplication,” both its shape and its distribution, can be explained as a phonotactic repair which operated at a prior stage of the language.

A goal feature is simply a uF that can find no match in its complement. I propose that before the point of phasal transfer, DELAYED VALUATION of uFs is possible either in situ within the same phase; or ex situ, by raising to c-command a potential valuer in a higher phase. uCase is a feature of D that finds no match in its complement NP, and therefore relies on DELAYED VALUATION in situ or by movement depending on the distance from a Case-licensor (see Bobaljik & Wurmbrand 2005 on two ways of valuing German nominative). The analysis of Case-driven movement converges in important respects with proposals of Boskovic (2007, 2011) while nonetheless permitting the attested in situ strategy.\\r\\n \\r\\nThough the paper contributes to Case theory, its empirical core is a difference between West Germanic (WG) and Lubukusu complementizer agreement (CA) (see Haegeman 1992, Carstens 2003, Haegeman & van Koppen 2010 on the former; Diercks 2010 and to appear on the latter). WG CA reflects the features of the embedded subject, while Lubukusu CA agrees with the subject of the higher clause. I argue that WG CA is the low complementizer Finite in the cartography of Rizzi (1997); it can therefore probe the embedded subject upon Merge. In contrast Lubukusu’s agreeing C is the high, phasal complementizer Force, Merged after the subject is transferred to PF, so like uCase it finds no value in its complement. I argue that uPhi of Force obtains values by raising of ForceP to an outer Spec, vP for DELAYED VALUATION from the matrix subject. The movement analysis is motivated by the fact that uPhi of Force agree with the subject even when ForceP is Merged within the VP complement to a phasal Applicative head (cf. McGinnis 2001). Absent raising, ForceP would be transferred to PF unvalued. The applied object (IO) itself cannot value uPhi of Force, I argue, because Lubukusu subjects and IOs contrast in that the latter are Case-licensed in situ (cf. Halpert 2011) while the former are not; hence IOs are “deactivated” and cannot value Lubukusu agreeing C.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter presenting the analysis of contrasting complementizer agreement varieties and developing the theory of DELAYED VALUATION, my paper explores German nominative in detail and then relates the proposals to agreement displacement (cf. Bejar & Rezac 2009), creating a unified approach. Lastly I argue, somewhat speculatively, that raising of a uF to be closest c-commandee may suffice to provide DELAYED VALUATION. Directionality of search arises always and only for derivational reasons at first Merge (Epstein 1998); hence the conclusion in (1):\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) MECHANICS OF DELAYED VALUATION: uF with no match in its c-command domain at Merge may be valued:\\r\\n\\r\\n(i) Ex situ, by raising into locality with a matching feature in a higher phase, OR\\r\\n(ii) In situ, by a matching feature within the same phase.',\n",

This paper provides support for this general picture by presenting parsing evidence for the intermediate traces created by successive-cyclic movement. It furthermore uses this parsing evidence to investigate the distribution of these intermediate traces. The central findings of this paper are (i) that successive-cyclic movement targets the edge of finite clauses and (ii) that no intermediate landing sites exist at the edges of (extended) VPs. These conclusions are fully consistent with traditional characterizations of successive-cyclicity but at variance with more recent approaches that hold that even movement within a single clause is successive-cyclic. A reassessment of arguments put forth in support of the latter hypothesis reveals them to be less compelling than they are standardly taken to be, which provides converging evidence for the parsing conclusions reached here.

With respect to phonological behaviour, both types of composite structures undergo vowel raising at the right edge of each element in the construction and vowel sandhi processes between their elements. In this paper, I show that word-word compounds and stressed aﬃx + word structures exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerences in stress assignment in BP, which supports their prosodization in two separate domains. While stressed aﬃx + word structures are assigned primary and secondary stress as simple phonological words (PWds), each element in word-word compounds behaves as an independent PWd with regard to stress assignment. I thus propose that while stressed aﬃx + word structures are recursively prosodized in the PWd domain, word-word compounds are prosodized in the composite group, the domain proposed by Vogel (2008, 2009) that immediately dominates the PWd and accounts for the prosodization of structures with compositional characteristics. My analysis reconciles two views on prosodic structure that are traditionally assumed to be mutually exclusive: the view that prosodic domains can be recursive (e.g. Inkelas (1990), Selkirk (1996)) and the view that the prosodic hierarchy includes an additional domain speciﬁc to composite structures above the PWd (e.g Vogel (2009)).',\n",

We argue that these phenomena can be given a unified treatment in terms of the scopal properties of subjective epistemic attitudes, once it is assumed that factive and veridical predicates, as well as verbs of proffering, force their complement to be closed off by a factive operator, irrespective of whether that complement is a proposition or a question (see Spector and Égré 2015 for related ideas). The proposed account relies on a theory of scope in which scope shift is encoded through percolation of scope indices constrained by a minimality condition (the Condition on Scope Shift; Neeleman & Van de Koot 2012).

The openness parameter is used in the current IPA system, in which vowels are classified into four categories: “close” vs. “close-mid” vs. “open-mid” vs. “open”. In order to quantitatively examine this concept of openness in detail, the current paper presents an articulatory study using EMA (ElectroMagnetic Articulograph) with Japanese as the target language. The main aim of this experiment is to provide exact measures of the amount of jaw opening of the five vowels in Japanese, and to investigate how the results would bear on the abstract concept of vowel openness. Our results show that while the traditional labeling of openness is more or less correct, we also observe that between the vowels of the same openness, front vowels are more open than back vowels (e.g. [e] is more open than [o]). Our results thus provide some information that goes beyond what the current IPA description of Japanese offers (Okada, 1999). We also examine the acoustic correlates of vowel openness, and compare them to jaw opening patterns. The result shows that, unsurprisingly, F1 is the most reliable correlate of vowel openness, but that other secondary cues, such as duration, F0, and intensity, are not very reliable, at least when measured in our task format.',\n",

Surprisingly, however, discussions of what constitutes evidence in research on meaning are almost non-existent. The goal of this paper is to open the discussion by advancing a proposal about the nature of empirical evidence in research on meaning. Our proposal is based primarily on insights we and our colleagues have gained in research on under-studied languages and in quantitative research using offline measures, but we intend the proposal to cover research on natural language meaning more broadly, including research on well- studied languages that the researcher may even control natively.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur proposal has three parts. First, we argue that a complete piece of data in research on meaning consists of a linguistic expression, a context in which the expression is uttered, a response by a native speaker to a task involving the expression in that context, and information about the native speakers that provided the responses. Incomplete pieces of data fail to satisfy our three proposed objectives that data be stable, replicable and transparent. Second, we argue that some response tasks, namely acceptability and implication judgment tasks, are better suited than others (e.g., paraphrase and translation tasks) for yielding stable, replicable and transparent pieces of data. Finally, we argue that empirical evidence for a hypothesis about meaning consists of one positive piece of data, or two pieces in minimal pair form, plus a linking hypothesis about how the piece(s) of data provide support for the meaning hypothesis. We show that different types of minimal pairs provide evidence for different types of meaning hypotheses.',\n",

However, an analysis of vowel raising in pronominal clitic se (3SG/PL.REFL/INDET/PASS) and non-pronominal clitic se (‘if’) shows that the phenomenon is significantly more frequent in non-pronominal se. This fact, as well as morphosyntactic distinctions between these two categories of clitics, indicates that pronominal and non-pronominal clitics are mapped onto the prosodic hierarchy in two separate domains. While non-pronominal clitics are prosodized in the phonological phrase (PPh), pronominal clitics are prosodized in the composite group (CG; Vogel (2009)), the domain between the phonological word (PWd) and the PPh onto which structures with compositional characteristics are prosodically mapped.',\n",

If our analysis is on the right track, any analysis of segmental phonology like palatalization potentially requires an understanding of syntax and semantics.

A raised category must stop in the position where it completes the valuation of all of its own unvalued features, which corresponds to the Criterial Position. In the Halting Problem, a wh-object agrees with the embedded C that has Q and is frozen in that Spec. In the Empty Category Principle, a wh-subject should in principle move across a declarative complementizer, since Agree does not occur between the wh-subject and the embedded C that does not have Q. The violation of the Empty Category Principle is not idiosyncratic any longer, with the that-trace effect attributed to the matter of phonology. In the Extended Projection Principle, a subject must move to [Spec,TP] to value its own unvalued Case feature, since the latter cannot be valued by v*. With the subject located in [Spec,TP] both in English and in Italian, whether an overt subject is required or not is attributed to the requirement from the phonological component.

Additionally, we found that Tunisian Arabic has the highest level of mutual intelligibility with either of the other two varieties.

I analyze these indefinites as contrastive topics, using Büring’s (1999) theory. I propose that the topic is evaluated in relation to a scalar set including generalized quantifiers such as {\\uf06cP \\uf024x P(x), \\uf06cP MANYx P(x), \\uf06cP MOSTx P(x), \\uf06cP \\uf022xP(x)} or {\\uf06cP \\uf024xP(x), \\uf06cP P(a), \\uf06cP P(b) ...}.

The speaker asserts that his claim is certainly true or highly probable, contrasting it with stronger claims for which the degree of probability is unknown. This explains the observation that in downward entailing contexts, the fronted quantified DPs are headed by ‘all’ or ‘many’, whereas ‘some(thing)’, small numbers or ‘at least n’ appear in upward entailing contexts. Unlike other cases of non-specific topics, which are property topics, these are quantifier topics: the topic part is a generalized quantifier, the comment is a property of generalized quantifiers.

This contrasts with the current analysis of e.g. ma as an interrogative force head.

We investigate this phenomenon in ASL and establish some basic properties: the phenomenon extends to temporal and modal shift; indexical loci are not usually locative-shifted; Locative Shift may have interpretive consequences, which suggests that the co-opted spatial/temporal/modal locus can refer to an individual-in-a-situation, and this contribution sometimes appears to be at-issue; and Locative Shift can occur in highly iconic cases, possibly even without prior establishment of a situation-denoting locus. We further investigate the behavior of the co-opted loci under ellipsis. In some cases, their locative specifications are disregarded in the elided clause, yielding different readings from unelided controls; this happens when locative specifications can be taken to be inherited by agreement, but possibly also in a rather unconstrained fashion. In other cases locative specifications appear not be disregarded under ellipsis, possibly even with elided indexical pronouns, despite the fact that these resist overt Locative Shift. We show that our basic findings can be replicated in LSF, although our data leave many questions open. Finally, we argue that some pointing gestures in English can undergo something like Locative Shift.\\r\\n\",\n",

Prevalent approaches in linguistics advance the idea that adult adjective ordering is determined by abstract syntax, with adjectives grouped into lexical semantic classes that are hierarchically ordered. Recent work has identified adjective subjectivity as a robust predictor of adult ordering preferences, with less subjective adjectives preferred closer to the modified noun; ordering preferences -- and the lexical class ordering observed cross-linguistically -- could then derive from the perceived subjectivity of the adjectives. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe current paper assesses when more abstract knowledge about adjective ordering emerges, how that knowledge gets represented, and whether the knowledge representation matches what we believe to be active in adults.

The study also argue that ʃikil heads Moodevidential Phrase (cf. Cinque 1999) and is endowed with a set of unvalued, uninterpretable Φ-features. The valuation of such features is morphologically realized as an inflectional suffix on ʃikil, expressing the same Φ-content of the element that ʃikil agrees with. Additionally, the current research shows that T0 (and ʃikil) in JA can agree with the object in active voice as long as the object is a topic situated in the low IP area (cf. Belletti 2004), c-commanding the thematic subject. Evidence coming from the casesensitive personal pronouns demonstrates that the object in such cases is assigned nominative case (by T°), which, we suggest, overrides the object’s accusative case, already assigned by little v0 prior to its movement to the low IP area',\n",

       "  'The phenomenon of case has been studied widely at both the descriptive and theoretical levels. Typological work on morphological case systems has provided a picture of the variability of case cross-linguistically. In particular, languages may differ with respect to whether or not arguments are marked with overt morphological case, the inventory of cases with which they may be marked, and the alignment of case marking (e.g. nominative-accusative vs. ergative-absolutive). In the theoretical realm, not only has morphological case been argued to play a role in multiple syntactic phenomena, but current generative work also debates the role of abstract case (i.e. Case) in the grammar: abstract case features have been proposed to underlie morphological case, and to license nominals in the derivation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phenomenon of case has been argued to play a role in at least three areas of the syntax: (i) agreement, (ii) A-movement, and (iii) A’-movement. Bobaljik (2008) provides convincing evidence that morphological case—rather than grammatical function—determines a nominal argument’s eligibility to participate in verbal agreement. Preminger (2014), building upon Bobaljik’s work, claims that languages vary as to whether movement to subject position is case-sensitive. As for case-sensitive A’-movement, recent literature debates whether this phenomenon should be seen as another instance of ‘case discrimination’ (Deal 2016c) or whether the pattern arises from other properties of ergative languages (e.g. Henderson and Coon 2016). Finally, other recent work (e.g. Brown 2016) has examined agreement and A’ extraction patterns in languages with no visible case morphology (e.g. Mayan, Tsimshianic, and Salishan languages). It is shown that the presence of patterns and typological gaps—both in languages with overt morphological case and in those without it—lends support to the relevance of abstract case in the syntax.',\n",

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that the VM is written in a natural language by establishing a relation between the Voynichese text and classical Persian. In the VM not the standard Arabic-derived Persian alphabet is used, but a different alphabet that has similarities to Pahlavi and Mandaic script. Based on a transcription table, we can directly translate text from the VM which is shown for a page (f16r) that displays a cannabis plant. We obtain clear evidence for our hypothesis by the fact that a meaningful translation can be obtained for a continuous passage of VM text in a relatively easy and fully documented procedure. Although we do not attempt at a critical translation of the VM text here, we gain a first insight into the content of the VM, which may provide a basis for discussions of the provenance of the VM. The present attempt builds on earlier work of the author on the Pahlavi hypothesis, but revises some of the claims made in the previous paper [7].',\n",

       "  'In Landau (2015), it is proposed that the acceptability of control by the implicit external argument of a passivized verb into complement clauses (implicit control) is not only restricted by the Revised Visser’s Generalization (van Urk 2013), but also depends on the type of matrix predicate involved. While attitude matrix predicates allow implicit control (implicit logophoric control), non-attitude matrix predicates do not. Landau takes this bifurcation to support his Two-Tiered Theory of Control, by assuming that in the case of non-attitude matrix predicates, the control relation is essentially a predication relation, from which implicit arguments are independently excluded. In this paper, we subject these claims to empirical scrutiny, showing that Landau’s generalization on implicit control holds only in a subset of languages, while other languages license implicit control with both types of matrix predicates. We investigate and reject the hypothesis that this cross-linguistic split is the consequence of different types of implicit arguments, only some of them being syntactically represented in a way that they can enter a predication relation. Based on an investigation of the acceptability of agent-modifying depictives in passives, we conclude that, in principle, implicit external arguments of passives in all languages under consideration can enter predication. We show, however, that there is a different correlation: languages which allow implicit control with non-attitude verbs (implicit predicative control) are exactly those languages that allow impersonal passives of unergative predicates. We account for this correlation by showing that implicit logophoric control, but not implicit predicative control can be construed as a personal passive. Our analysis appears to be at odds with the Revised Visser’s Generalization, which holds that personal passives block implicit control. Yet, we provide independent evidence that this generalization needs to be adjusted and this adjustment renders our analysis fully compatible with the Revised Visser’s Generalization. ',\n",

Much recent work in the last few decades shows that phonological knowledge is stochastic (e.g. Hayes & Londe 2006). Building on this body of research, we show that in Japanese, gradient phonological knowledge affects several word formation patterns in stochastic ways. Concretely, we show that identity avoidance effects hold at both the segmental and the CV-moraic levels. These identity avoidance effects stochastically affect two types of word formation patterns in Japanese: group name formation and rendaku. We show that Maximum Entropy Grammar (Goldwater & Johnson 2003), together with multiple OCP constraints (Coetzee & Pater 2008), successfully models both of the observed morphological word formation patterns, without any further stipulation. In addition to this theoretical contribution, one of the patterns discussed in this paper—group name formation—has not been analyzed from the perspective of formal phonological theories before, and hence this paper has descriptive novelty as well.',\n",

In the following example, the  proleptic  constituent  is  governed  by  a  preposition  and  semantically  related  to  a  position \\r\\noccupied by a coreferential pronoun: I believe of John that he likes Mary. While at first sight, one may  take  the  proleptic  constituent  to  be  an  argument  of  the  matrix  verb  with  the  pronoun establishing  an  anaphoric  dependency,  things  are  more  complex:  First,  the  construction  is \\r\\npossible with a very wide range of matrix verbs, casting doubt on the argumenthood of the object. Second, a coreferential element is obligatory (cf. *I believe of this crisis that the president should resign),  which  argues  against  a  mere  aboutness  relationship.  There  is  conflicting  evidence \\r\\nconcerning the base position of the proleptic object. On the one hand, there is solid evidence from anaphor  binding  and  superiority  that  the  proleptic  object  occupies  an  A-position  in  the  matrix clause.  On  the  other  hand,  the  proleptic  object  reconstructs  into  the  complement  clause  for \\r\\nanaphor  and  variable  binding;  furthermore,  the  proleptic  object  turns  the  construction  into  a (weak) island for extraction.

It is proposed that these paradoxical properties follow if the proleptic object is licensed by predication: The complement clause involves a base-generated operator which turns it into  an  open  sentence.  The  coreferential  pronoun  is  the  variable  bound  by  the  operator.  The proleptic  object,  then,  is  the  subject  of  the  predication.

Our framework has the following tenets: (i) Music cognition is continuous with normal auditory cognition. (ii) In both cases, the semantic content derived from an auditory percept can be identified with the set of inferences it licenses on its causal sources, analyzed in appropriately abstract ways (e.g. as 'voices' in some Western music). (iii) What is special about music semantics is that it aggregates inferences based on normal auditory cognition with further inferences drawn on the basis of the behavior of voices in tonal pitch space (through more or less stable positions, for instance). (iv)  This makes it possible to define an inferential semantics but also a truth-conditional semantics for music. In particular, a voice undergoing a musical movement m is true of an object undergoing a series of events e just in case there is a certain structure-preserving map between m and e. (v) Aspects of musical syntax (notably Lerdahl and Jackendoff's 'time-span reductions') might be derivable on semantic grounds from an event mereology ('partology'), which also explains some cases in which tree structures are inadequate for music (overlap, ellipsis). (vi) Intentions and emotions may be attributed at several levels (the source, the musical narrator, the musician), and we speculate on possible explanations of the special relation between music and emotions.\",\n",

I will argue that this construction indeed represents a proper verb cluster and not an instance of the 3rd Construction, which also allows for the 213 order. Based on new diagnostics, viz., stranding of VP3 under topicalization of the governing VP2, short relative clause extraposition and displaced zu, I will show that verb clusters and Verb Projection Raising differ from the 3rd Construction with respect to the structural position of the dependent VP: While the dependent VP is contained within the projection of the governing verb in the former, it occurs outside of the projection of the governing verb in the latter. Applying the diagnostics to the Swiss German 213 construction delivers a clear result: The construction patterns with verb clusters rather than the 3rd Construction.

We then turn to investigate the relationship between PSE and other ellipsis cases in Japanese. We present various arguments, based on sloppy readings, partial negation, disjunction, and parallelism, to show that PSE involves argument ellipsis, one of the most intensively investigated phenomena in the latest generative literature on Japanese syntax (Oku 1998; Saito 2007; Takahashi 2008), arguing against the conceivable pro-drop alternative.

Classic OO-Corr involves correspondence between an output [X-Y] and a subconstituent base [X], e.g. a derived stem with a bare root [√-DERIV]x ↔ [√]x (párent-hood ↔ párent). Further, Paradigmatic OO-Corr (Pa-OO-C) involves correspondence between an output [X-A] and a base [X-B], where the affixes [A] and [B] share a morphosyntactic feature [+F] which places them together in a morphological paradigm (McCarthy 2005, Hall & Scott 2007), e.g. [√-INFL[1SG PAST]]x ↔ [√-INFL[1SG PRES]]x. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel type of OO-Corr termed Transparadigmatic Output-Output Correspondence (Tr-OO-C), involving correspondence between an output [X-Y-Z] and a base [X-Z]. Under Tr-OO-C, morphologically-related forms share the same root as well as share the same outer morphology, but differ in terms of an inner morphology, e.g. [√-DERIV-INFL]x ↔ [√-INFL]x. I argue that Ese Ejja (Takanan: Bolivia) is an example of Tr-OO-C, wherein there is unexpected stress uniformity between inflectional and derivational verbal forms. I argue that derivational forms are in correspondence with an inflectional base enforced by highly ranked constraints ID-BO(STRESS), CORR-BO(ROOT), and CORR-BO(INFL), modeled after Agreement-By-Correspondence (Rose & Walker 2004).

Due to the feature [π], simple clitics must undergo an unusual long outbound movement under OCP.

The feature [ω] has a further effect in the grammar: it forces the agreement of past participles and direct object clitics.

Chomsky’s (2013; 2015) focus on labeling as unconnected to merge makes it possible to see the cycles in another way, namely as resolutions to labeling problems. The Labeling Algorithm (LA) operates after merge is complete, at the point that a syntactic derivation is transferred to the interfaces. When a head and a phrase merge, the LA automatically determines the head to be the label. In cases where two phrases merge, the LA cannot find the head and one of the phrases either has to move or share features with the other. I will argue that, in addition to Chomsky’s resolutions to labeling paradoxes, reanalyzing a phrase as a head also resolves the paradox. This change is very frequent as I show in eight cross-linguistically attested changes which are part of full cycles. In addition, in the renewal stage of a cycle, adjuncts are frequently incorporated as arguments and this shows a preference of set-merge (feature-sharing) over pair-merge.',\n",

Using French as a case study, this paper argues that all gender features—even those which have been seen as arbitrary—are necessarily interpretable at the LF interface. Even if a feature does not contribute compositionally to the meaning of a structure, it must be visible to provide the context for interpretation. This leads to an argument for the abandonment of the interpretable-uninterpretable distinction in the representation of features. Instead, the analysis contends that the mechanism of interpretation is responsible for differences in the semantic contribution of features: both heads and sub-structures can be taken as input to the interpretive mechanism. The interpretation of heads leads to compositional meaning, and the interpretation of sub-structures to non-compositional meaning. The system has the consequence of simplifying restrictions on gender specification such that they are solely linked to the availability of a semantic interpretation, rather than to a combination of phonological and semantic licensing conditions.',\n",

We provide a critical discussion of recent research into this phenomenon (Kramer & Rawlins 2009; Krifka 2013; Roelofsen & Farkas 2015; Holmberg 2016), which leads to three questions: Does the intonation produced on yes and no depend on whether the response is positive or negative, and can intonation affect the interpretation of bare polar particle responses? Which particles do speakers prefer to use when? Are preference patterns sensitive to the polarity of preceding sentences in the context? In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the contradiction contour (Liberman & Sag 1974) is an intonation that is commonly produced on positive responses to negative sentences, and that it affects hearers’ interpretations of bare particle responses. Beyond intonation, our experimental results add new evidence regarding speakers’ preferences for using yes and no in response to negative polar questions and rising declaratives. Finally, our results suggest that preference patterns are not sensitive to the polarity of context sentences.',\n",

       "  \"It is standardly assumed that nominals in the languages of the world are syntactically complex in the typical case, being made up of not just NP, but one or more functional projections, e.g., DP (Abney, 1987). Recently, this assumption has been questioned, especially for languages without articles (Bošković (2005), et seq.). The alternative proposal holds that nominals in Serbo-Croatian (and more strongly, languages without articles in general) lack the DP projection, and that this difference has a variety of syntactic consequences. In this paper, I investigate the nominal extended projection of another language without articles, Estonian (Finno-Ugric). On the basis of a number of facts about Estonian's system of adnominal genitives, I conclude that nominals in Estonian should not be given the same analysis as those in Serbo-Croatian. I propose instead that Estonian's nominals are DPs. I then propose that indefinite pronouns and wh-determiners instantiate the category D in the language, arguing that DP does more cross-linguistically than host articles. I conclude that nominal structure in languages without articles can be just as complex as nominal structure in languages with articles.\",\n",

But in Adıyaman Kurmanji, our focus here, the effect is partial: the number feature of third person oblique subjects can be registered on the verb. We account for the difference by saying that overtly case marked nominals are in fact agreed with in the syntax, but the actual transfer of phi-feature values happens at PF, where it is sensitive to post syntactic operations like Fusion. All and only heads that fuse with case (a K head) can feed valuation and thus be realized on the agreement probe. Adıyaman Kurmanji is a language where number fuses with K and this feeds agreement, resulting in partial agreement with overtly case marked nominals (in number but not person), whereas Hindi is not. The possibility of object agreement in these languages is, we claim, the result of Multiple Agree, which creates complex feature bundles on agreement probes that are only partially realized morphologically at PF. We further support our theory by applying it to Icelandic and Faroese, languages often thought not to have agreement with oblique subjects, but which may allow agreement in very specific situations which our theory elucidates.',\n",

In this case, reflexives reveal the ability to be coreferential or co-bound with their local antecedents, rather than strictly semantically bound by them.|\\r\\nThe tasks are then two-fold: to explain where the mismatching outer indices come from, and to explain why mismatches between inner and outer indices are not tolerated in all cases of reflexive binding. My suggestion on the first count goes by way of a crucially syntactic component for the binding theory. Index features are present in syntax and transferred by Agree between DPs and the functional heads that attract them. My suggestion on the second count puts together Reinhart’s (1983a, 1983b) idea that semantic binding is preferred by linguistic systems with Johnson’s (2007) view that we find locality domains in grammar by considering the domains that are relevant for the evaluation of interface constraints.',\n",

After discussing categorial identity through these perspectives, this work first traces the origins and manifestations of Identity Avoidance in language and other domains of human cognition, with emphasis on attention orienting. Second, it proposes a new processing principle, the Novel Information Bias, that (i) captures linguistic Identity Avoidance based on how the brain decodes types and tokens and (ii) explains the universal fact that generally the existence of adjacent occurrences of syntactically and/or phonologically identical tokens is severely constrained.',\n",

Empirical evidence in favor of both approaches exists, yet very few attempts have been made to model them together. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new MaxEnt-compatible model of phonological typology that models both AB and CB together. The first step towards a new model of typology is to establish quantitative models of each of the subcomponents: AB and CB. To encode the AB portion of the typology, we adopt Wilson’s (2006) approach of differentiating variance in the prior of a MaxEnt model of phonological learning; to encode the CB portion, we adopt Beguš’s (2016) new model of typology within CB that operates with Historical Probabilities of Alternations and an estimation method called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. This paper proposes a new model of typology that combines differentiating prior variance (AB; Wilson 2006) with estimating Historical Weights based on Historical Probabilities (CB; Beguš 2016), whereby both variables influence the typology. I further argue that this new model performs better than the current “split” models on the basis of two alternations, post-nasal voicing and devoicing, and point to future directions this line of research should take.

I also show that the relevant ‘inalienably possessed’ weak definites are not restricted to body parts, but include a broader set of nouns with a stereotypical function that are located in or on the body of an animate possessor/ location: mental or physical faculties, facial expressions, as well as articles of clothing, protection, and adornment. This set of nouns displays a number of peculiar restrictions on the verbs that select them. I argue that all of these restrictions derive from the requirement that the semantic properties of weak definites and the syntactic configuration of the RP need to be compositionally respected.

I derive the observed distributional differences between languages from the range of values available for the interpretation of this component.

In order to verify them, we consider the following four facts: (i) clause-boundedness of Move-R, (ii) exceptionality of Move-R in comparatives, (iii) availability of multiple Move-R, and (iv) ellipsis-specific nature of Move-R. Based on these facts, we argue that the QR approach is preferable, because it derives all the facts, while the SP approach does not. Furthermore, we lend support to the QR approach by pointing out that Move-R shows similar behavior to overt QR in Icelandic, which Svenonius (2000) refers to as Quantifier Movement.

       "  'This thesis investigates the so-called \"hybrid agreement\" phenomenon in Slavic languages and beyond, where agreement can reflect either formal or semantic features of a noun. Agreement of the so-called \"split hybrid nouns\" in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian is challenging since the possibility of hybrid agreement in gender depends on number: optionality between formal (feminine) and semantic (masculine) gender agreement obtains only in the plural, while in the singular agreement is consistently semantic. The thesis addresses three central research questions raised by such patterns: (i)How can semantic and formal features be simultaneously encoded on a noun? (ii) How can hybrid agreement patterns be formally derived? (iii) What do hybrid nouns\\r\\nreveal about the interaction between different agreement targets (e.g. adjectives and verbs)? The obligatoriness of semantic agreement in the singular and optionality in the plural is derived as a strictly local syntactic process which involves a combination of the following factors: (i) the complex structure of nominal categories and feature-geometric structure of phi-features, (ii) the articulated nature of the phi-probe (Relativized probing), and (iii) the order of agreement operations. Part II explores the implications of the analysis in deriving the effects of the Agreement Hierarchy, a crosslinguistic tendency that pertains to asymmetries among different types of agreement targets, while Part III does the same for the Predicate Hierarchy, another crosslinguistic tendency concerned with agreement asymmetries among different types of predicates.',\n",

In doing so, we find that both AAA quotative like and Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ are attested prior to what seems to be the relatively recent adoption of AAA’s pre-existing quotative into colloquial white American English, which is only first attested in the 1980s.

This paper presents novel evidence for this idea from the verbal agreement system of Yimas. As a radical departure from previous characterizations of the language, this paper argues that the Yimas agreement morphemes are actually doubled pronominal clitics, and that they exhibit paradigmatic alternations that parallel the distributions of lexical, dependent, and unmarked case on nominals cross-linguistically. The core evidence comes from the fact that clitic doubling in Yimas is optional. Once this optionality is taken into account, it is revealed that the morphological form of a given clitic covaries with the total number of clitics present, even when the sentence-level syntax is held constant: how a clitic is ultimately realized is thus dependent on its clitic environment. This context-dependence is analyzed as a dissimilation process, which applies to distinguish between multiple morphosyntactically indistinguishable clitics; this arises whenever multiple DPs are doubled. The link to dependent case comes from the parallel between the distribution of clitic forms and that of dependent case on nominals, in that both can be viewed as controlled by morphosyntactic context, albeit in different structural domains.',\n",

Specifically, might scientific validity be enhanced by re-factoring the architecture of generative linguistics from a directly mathematical sound-meaning connection to a functional connection between linguistic intention and linguistic expression? Can the operational presence of structural intention in generative grammar illuminate further the fundamental significance of C-Command and Merge operations of the Minimalist Program?  Might linguistic structural intent extend the basic Chomskyan focus on linguistic creativity (unbounded generation from finite means) to a new level of representation  useful for explaining and constraining the inventive means by which the species-specific features of human language are effected?  Can theoretical gains be achieved  by extending the Chomskyan idea to generation of structure from linguistic intent oriented more to the creative generative process of sentence creation than interpretation by the listener? Is Chomsky’s profound attention to the creativity of human language enhanced by extension to the domain of linguistic structural intent?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main thesis of the present work is that there exists an empirically evident necessity for the representation of linguistic structural intent which has been generally overlooked in the theory of language, including notably centralized configurational syntax in the generative program.  We propose and motivate Tool Grammar , in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  A sentence intention is a formative set of decisions for external representation of thought by means of highly constrained, conventional, interlocking structures and processes, which we call ‘tools’.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts.  A revision of the architecture of competence shifting away from the strict centrality of syntax can increase the potential for explanatory power in the generative program.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral specific conceptions of language characterize the TG approach to linguistic analysis.  \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tWhile the Generative Program has not always built on a clear definition of the basic units of language, TG defines a sentence as that externalized communication structure which carries the selective representation of meaning resulting from the targeted set of speaker decisions made for the purpose of effecting linguistic intent. This definition orients the sentence to speaker action rather than interpretation thereby distinguishing linguistic intent from the wider phenomena of interpretation and implication that characterize receptive activities.  A language therefore is conceived not so much as a set of sentences that need to be accounted for, but a set of structures considered in the context of active decisions about structure and representation on the part of the speaker.   \\r\\n•\\tWhile the Generative Program has classically taken as its basic problem to develop a theory of the non-directional syntactic connection between meaning (logical form) and  output (e.g. phonological form), (Chomsky, Sophia Lectures, 2014) TG re-factors the architecture of language competence rather to connect linguistic intentions to output as a directional generative process.  This at once adds an intention generator as a new module in the competence framework and also defines a new relationship to truth functional interpretation semantics and the study of implication.  For TG, the meanings hearers take from an utterance, which are evidently various and diverse, involve a different set of processes from the speaker’s intentional engagement to represent particular meaning structures.  This means that the various interpretations that might or might not be taken from a particular utterance warrant a separate analysis from that of the representation the speaker intended to make.  Another consequence of this re-factoring is that the source of creativity and recursion is moved outside the purveyance of syntax to the intention module. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTG holds that language has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.   Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A broad swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs an illustration, the following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl visited the sick woman.\\r\\nThe sick woman was visited by Al.\\r\\nWhat was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.\\r\\n*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe here incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is one tip-of-the-iceberg example of the myriad issues, far beyond the simple topic/focus conflict seen here, that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe operative hypotheses of this paper surround the question whether linguistic rules are preferably formulated in terms of linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has perhaps not heretofore been fully examined to resolution. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we seek to demonstrate that linguistic theory is strengthened when it inclines toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal is to show that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactual complexity and undesirably precludes the discovery of powerful natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more natural solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax.  TG argumentation, by adding a new dimension of recordable and verifiable data subject to independent validation, thereby enjoys resistance to the view that it is merely stipulative or reductionist and facilitates a new way of looking at generative grammar. \\r\\n',\n",

In this paper, we diverge from this trend, claiming that the two approaches suffer from a lack of empirical adequacy. As an alternative, we propose an analysis within the theory of Optimality Theory, with the basic assumption being that the linearization of the causative morpheme is instead the result of phonological well-formedness interacting with the morphological process of causativization. An important empirical prediction of our analysis is that the causative affix can neither move to word-initial positions nor word-final positions under the pressure of phonological well-formedness constraints. This is shown to be an example of the Emergence of the Unmarked, wherein the otherwise inactive markedness constraint *COMPLEXONSET in the language bears the burden of the explanation.

       "  \"Recent comparative semantics suggests that sign language makes use of the same logical resources as spoken language, but has richer mechanisms of iconic enrichment. It is often thought that when speech is analyzed in tandem with  iconic gestures, 'expressive parity' is regained between speech and sign. But this comparison between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures turns out to be complex because iconic enrichments often have a non-at-issue status, as attested by their interaction with logical operators. We argue that the status of iconic enrichments is constrained by two parameters: ±internal, ±separate_time_slot.  If an enrichment is effected by the internal modification  of an expression (+internal) – e.g. by lengthening the word loooong in English, or of the sign GROW in ASL – it can have any semantic status and can in particular be at-issue. If an enrichment is an external addition to an expression (-internal) – as is the case of co-speech gestures in English – it does not make an at-issue contribution, but it may have the status of a presupposition or of a supplement. If an enrichment has a separate time slot (+separate_time_slot), it may not be trivial (= presupposed), and must thus be at-issue or supplemental. The generalization is assessed on the basis of vocal iconicity in spoken language, iconic modulations in sign language, co-speech as well as 'post-speech' gestures and facial expressions in spoken and sign language, and also gestures that fully replace words in spoken language. Our typology suggests that there are systematic expressive differences between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures, and also that the semantic status of iconic enrichments can in part be predicted by parameters pertaining to their form.\",\n",

Rather, various previously proposed diagnostics\\r\\nfor scalar change actually pick out at least two distinct notions — entailing change along a scale regardless of whether a new state obtains for the theme argument more broadly and change along a scale that does result in a new state more narrowly. We specifically examine verbs of manner-of-motion, with a special emphasis on the verb climb, and show that there is a subclass of manner-of-motion verbs that entail scalar change without a new result and are themselves also crossclassified by other standard distinctions among scalar change verbs. These observations have several consequences. First, manner-of-motion verbs are not as distinct from path verbs\\r\\nas prior work in the Talmy typology has suggested. Second, prior diagnostics for identifying result verbs and subtypes of result verbs are sensitive to the various distinctions we propose, producing more nuanced results than previously assumed. Third, the observation that a large swath of manner-of-motion verbs also have result entailments further supports Beavers & Koontz-Garboden’s (2012) conclusion\\r\\nthat there is no truth conditional manner/result complementarity in verb meaning, expanding the base of potential counterexamples and raising questions about how the claim is meant to be interpreted.',\n",

In contrast, I argue that epistemic modals have felicity conditions that require that the prejacent is not known as claimed in Giannakidou & Mari 2016. New linguistic data is produced in support of this position. The proposed account is argued to explain the new evidence better than accounts that rely on indirectness. The evidence in favor of this account also militates in favor of a weak semantics for must p. In light of these findings, future prospects are explored. In particular, I suggest that this proposal paves the way for the felicity conditions of epistemic must to be derived as a conversational implicature. Furthermore, I demonstrate that a purported counterexample to the proposal, must p statements in the conclusions of deductions, is a problem for indirectness accounts as well, and I suggest a way forward.',\n",

The ScotE data cast doubt on Henry 1995's proposal that the licensor of postverbal subjects is weak agreement. I argue that the subjects in these constructions are actually  external arguments of small clauses (of which goal-PPs are taken to be a subset, following e.g. Beck & Snyder 2001). The differences between dialects is located in the structure of resultatives; standard English resultatives are proposed to be interpreted via a rule of semantic composition similar to von Stechow 1995's Principle R, while in BelfE, interpretation is mediated by a [cause] feature, which can assign Case to the small clause's external argument. ScotE is an intermediate case, where only light motion verbs are endowed with Case-assigning [cause]. The paper also discusses a construction in ScotE where 'away' can appear without an overt verb and with a postverbal subject ('away you to bed'), analyzing the structure as containing a null [cause]-marked motion verb.\",\n",

Based on cases of apparent unquotation in direct discourse constructions (including data from Kwaza speakers, Catalan signers, and Dutch children), I suggest a general pragmatic answer: unquotation is essentially a way to resolve a conflict that arises between two opposing constraints. On the one hand, the reporter wants to use indexicals that refer directly to the most salient speech act participants and their surroundings (Attraction). On the other hand, the semantics of direct discourse (formalized here in terms of event modification) entails the reproduction of referring expressions from the original utterance being reported (Verbatim). Unquotation (formalized here also in terms of event modification), allows the reporter to avoid potential conflicts between these constraints. Unquotation in free indirect discourse then comes out as a special case, where the salient source of attraction is the story protagonist and her actions, rather than the reporting narrator and his here and now.',\n",

However, in older Middle Frisian texts the non-normative auxiliary-first order also appears. This raises a question: is the modern use of this word order really a new development taken from Dutch, or something older? To study this, we have extracted verb clusters from a corpus of Early-Modern Frisian texts.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults show that auxiliary-first clusters are much more frequent in poetry than in prose. Furthermore, no effect of clause length or morphological complexity was found, unlike in modern Dutch.

This thesis focuses on four known points of cross-linguistic variation in the verbal domain: tense, aspect, finiteness and the perfect. It uses data primarily from the Dravidian language Malayalam to explore these questions.\\r\\nPast work on tense and aspect in Dravidian languages (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005) has claimed that Malayalam, along with the other Dravidian languages, is tenseless. This dissertation, however, shows that Malayalam is empirically different from other tenseless languages and that it does have morphology that encodes tense semantics and a TP. It further examines what have previously been called the two ‘imperfectives’ and argues that the first one is a type of progressive. The second form, is shown to be something between an interative and an imperfective. While the dissertation argues that Malayalam, has tense morphology and a TP, it argues that Malayalam lacks perfect morphology and a PerfP in, minimally, Universal perfects.\\r\\nThe investigation of finiteness focuses on the empirical facts regarding the different non-finite forms in Malayalam and the theoretical implications of these facts. It points out a problem for classifying negation as ‘finite’ versus ‘non-finite’, as has frequently been done (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005, a.o.) and argues that non- finite uses of the -uka marker are progressive participles, that Conjunctive Participles are best analyzed as Stump (1985)-style absolutives and that -athu gerunds involve nominalization above the TP-level (cf.

Previous accounts propose complex mapping between semantic, syntactic and class features, but ultimately cannot derive the obligatoriness of natural agreement in the singular and optionality in the plural in a unified way.

Additionally, we provide a detailed study of resumption in Asante Twi, showing that despite island-insensitivity, resumption is still derived by movement. Finally, the morpho-phonological side of the phenomenon is investigated.

       "  \" can give rise to agent indifference (AI) readings. We propose a novel account of AI that builds on the observation that the adverbial | references a simplicity order that determines, in relative terms, what is simple for the agentive subject of the host sentence. For |, we employ the by now standard assumption that it comes with a covert domain variable and activates subdomain alternatives. To derive AI, we argue that, if an agent has options for an action and preferences about which option to realize, then realizing one of many options (e.g. buying a single book from a large domain) is more complex than realizing one of fewer options (e.g. buying a single book from a subdomain). To create a link between the simplicity order referenced by | and the preference order employed in the derivation of AI, we show that the subdomain alternatives activated by | can be associated with decision problems, and that these decision problems are equally simple iff the decision maker doesn't have preferences as to which of the expressed options to realize.

We present a corpus-based quantitative model of the syncretisation of verbal subject agreement spanning the whole Medieval French period and evaluate two hypotheses relating agreement and null subjects: one relating the two as reflexes of the same grammatical property and a variational learning-based hypothesis whereby syncretic endings create a learning bias against the null subject grammar.

       "  'Japanese rendaku is a morphophonological phenomenon in which a morpheme-initial voiceless obstruent becomes voiced when it is the non-initial member of a compound. There are a number of factors that inhibit rendaku. A well-known factor is a voiced obstruent: Rendaku does not apply if the second member of compounds contains a voiced obstruent (i.e. Lyman’s Law, or OCP (-son, voice)). This paper focuses on another factor to block rendaku. Although /h/ usually becomes labial [b] when rendaku applies (e.g., hako ‘box’ + hune ‘ship’ → hakobune ‘ark’), the rendaku application of /h/ is blocked if the following consonant is labial [m] (e.g., suna ‘sand’ + hama ‘beach’ → sunahama ‘sand beach’/*sunabama). One hypothesis about this rendaku blocking is that, if /h/ became labial [b], it would beget a sequence of homorganic consonants [b...m], which would violate a putative OCP-labial effect. The current paper is the first report of an experiment that examined whether this restriction applies productively to nonce words that contain labial consonants. The results show that 1) the OCP- labial effect can be generalized in rendaku; 2) it works locally rather than non-locally; and 3) the applicability of rendaku is gradient: The more similar two consonants are, the more strongly they are disfavored. To account for this gradient effect, I argue that the process involves two OCP-labial constraints: OCP (labial) and OCP (labial, -continuant).',\n",

Inuktitut object DPs display various properties mirroring the behaviour of clitic doubled objects cross-linguistically, while in Kalaallisut they display none of these properties, suggesting genuine phi-agreement.

These make major empirical predictions, including Cyclic Containment, the Russian Doll Theorem, and Chung’s Generalization. The exposition highlights the fact that Stratal Phonology differs from other cyclic frameworks, such as Cophonology Theory, in positing relatively fewer cycles. Recent proposals are reviewed which look to independent facts in an effort to derive long-standing generalizations about cyclic domain structures: notably, the noncyclic status of roots and the recursiveness of stem-level domains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSection 3 addresses the contest between cyclicity and output-output correspondence, focusing on Steriade’s (1999) claim that English dual-level affixes like _-able_ challenge Cyclic Containment. I argue that, whilst Steriade’s argument draws force from important empirical facts, containment-compliant analyses centred on lexical acquisition not only describe the phenomena accurately, but also generate correct empirical predictions that are not matched by accounts relying on output-output correspondence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSection 4 assesses Stratal Phonology by evaluating the plausibility of its implications for morphology. I show, first, that the theory can derive the relative ordering of phonological strata without recourse to the Affix Ordering Generalization, and that it can handle bracketing paradoxes without recourse to rebracketing operations. At the same time, Stratal Phonology presupposes that morphology and phonology are distinct grammatical modules, and for this reason it favours concatenativist approaches to putative instances of process morphology, in line with Generalized Nonlinear Affixation.\\r\\n',\n",

       "  \"This paper provides support for a modified DM model which I call Optimality Theoretic Distributed Morphology (OT-DM). The strongest form of this model is that all morphological operations take place in parallel, which I call the Morphology-in-Parallel Hypothesis (MPH). Although combining OT and DM is unorthodox in practice, I show that a growing body of data warrants his modification (Trommer 2001a, 2001b, 2002; Dawson in press; Foley to appear; a.o.), and provide evidence for OT-DM from a morphological conspiracy involving verbal clitics in Degema (Nigeria). To account for this conspiracy, I argue that agreement clitics are inserted post-syntactically via the DM operation Dissociated Node Insertion (DNI), and further that verb complexes are formed post-syntactically via the operation Local Dislocation (LD). I argue that both these operations are triggered by a well-formedness markedness constraint which requires verbs to appear in properly inflected words on the surface. These DM operations are decomposed into a series of constraints which are crucially ranked. Candidates are freely generated from GEN and are subject to all DM operations, and are evaluated via EVAL against the ranked constraint set. I illustrate that under standard views of DM in which DNI proceeds VI, a serial model results in an ordering paradox, and that even after parameterizing DM operation ordering in response, this model does not adequately account for the morphological conspiracy.

       "  'In this paper, I argue for a theory of genericity that is based on neo-Davidsonian event semantics (Parson 1990& 2000; Higginbotham, 2000; etc.). I argue that in generic sentences there are ontologically two sorts of things that have generic interpretation: individuals and eventualities. I distinguish broadly between three types of individual: kind individuals, generic individuals and concrete individuals. A distinction is made between particular events and generic events on the one hand; and between kind-level states, individual-level states, stage-level states and generic states on the other hand.  I propose that only generic individuals truly require the presence of the Gen operator and that kind and concrete individuals are existentially closed with the logical form of kind individual involving a type-shifting operation. Also, I propose that generic events and generic states contain the generic predicate ‘gen (e)’ which turns concrete eventualities into generic ones and that the other types of eventuality also have their respective predicates that distinguish them from one another. Using this framework to account for genericity in Yoruba has two implications for current theories of genericity and event semantics. First, it is shown that Kimian states (Maienborn, 2007) in Yoruba have an E-position that the generic predicate (the imperfective) máa-ń targets (contrary to expectation). Second, in some constructions máa-ń is best treated as the operator Gen, suggesting that the so-called silent operator Gen is not always silent in Yoruba.',\n",

The study is based on Latin data, but in also includes cross-linguistic considerations. The analyses are framed in Partial Compositional Discourse Representation Theory (Haug 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin LDRs are frequent in indirect discourse in Latin as well as in other languages, and they refer to the author of the indirect discourse. Given this pattern, an analysis based on the modal semantics of indirect discourse easily comes to mind. However, LDRs are also attested in non-reported environments, which are often treated in terms of perspective shift. To capture the different uses, I argue that LDRs are anaphors with a presuppositional restriction to shifted perspective holders. Perspective shift is analyzed using events and thematic roles. This approach to perspective shift correctly captures the antecedents of LDRs in indirect discourse, but it can also account for other uses of LDRs. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen indirect discourse containing an LDR is embedded within indirect discourse, the LDR becomes ambiguous. By modeling LDR binding as anaphora, this ambiguity is immediately captured, without having to resort to covert structural differences. \\r\\n\\r\\nLatin LDRs are widely attested in so-called unembedded indirect discourse (UID; Bary and Maier 2014), multi-sentence stretches of indirect discourse. In such cases, the LDR is often several sentences away from its antecedent.  I show how UID can be analyzed in terms of event anaphora. When paired with the event-semantics of perspective shift, it is possible to capture the discourse antecedents of LDRs in UID.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I discuss the antecedents of Latin LDRs in indirect discourse conveyed by a messenger, which have previously been seen as problematic. I present a new corpus study of such cases and show how they can be explained.\\r\\n',\n",

The proposal defended here only adds (a) and (b) to Harbour’s system, making use of the rest of his apparatus to explain the data. It borrows (d) from the ambiguity approach to the plural in Farkas and de Swart (2010).

Based on French data and crosslinguistic comparisons, I first show that such ‘exempt’ anaphors must be anteceded by logophoric, i.e. perspective, centers. Elaborating on, but modifying Sells (1987), I argue that they can be of three kinds: intellectual (attitude holders), emotional (empathy loci) and perceptual (deictic centers). Specific tests are provided to justify this classification into these three types, the (un)availability of which explains crosslinguistic variation. Next, the logophoricity of exempt anaphors derives from the following hypothesis: seemingly exempt anaphors are in fact bound by silent, syntactically represented logophoric operators within their local domain. This hypothesis explains why exempt anaphors have to be anteceded by perspective centers (their interpretation is derived from their binder); it also accounts for the apparent exemption from Condition A, reanalyzed here as local binding by a silent operator. Ultimately, this means that plain and exempt anaphors are one and the same type of element subject to the same locality constraint, the apparent difference between them coming from the availability of implicit perspective coding in language.',\n",

       "  \"Appositives have been argued to provide a powerful argument in favor of a multidimensional semantics, one in which certain expressions fail to interact scopally with various operators because their meaning is located in a separate semantic dimension (Potts 2005, 2007). On this view, appositive relative clauses and nominals have an unexceptional syntax but a semantics that radically differs from that of superficially related constructions (restrictive modifiers on the one hand, presupposition-triggering expressions on the other) –hence the development of new semantic tools. An older line of research (e.g. McCawley 1998) posited instead that appositives have an unexceptional (and conjunctive) semantics, but a very non-standard syntax; in a nutshell, the view was that even when appositives appear to be deeply embedded, they can be attached to higher propositional nodes than meets the eye. This chapter reviews the phenomenological differences between appositives and superficially similar constructions, notably restrictive modifiers, presupposition triggers, and parentheticals. It introduces accounts based on a rich semantics, in particular Potts's bidimensional framework and more recent accounts in terms of 'post-suppositions'. It revisits arguments in favor of a syntactic approach to some 'wide scope' phenomena, following work by McCawley, and discusses various phenomena that have been taken to suggest that in other cases appositives can have genuinely narrow scope. It also lays out some data that suggest that sometimes the content of appositives 'projects' in a non-trivial way, possibly reminiscent of presupposition projection. While the issues continue to be the object of vigorous debates, they offer a particularly interesting case study in the division of labor between syntax, semantics and pragmatics.\",\n",

While the synchronic status of the AVS has been explored extensively, its diachronic development is less clear. This paper fills the gap in our understanding of the development of the AVS while simultaneously exploring the effectiveness of internal reconstruction as a tool of historical syntax. I argue that both voice marking and the nominalizing function of the AVS affixes were already present at the Proto-Austronesian stage. The analysis presented here capitalizes on simple and independently motivated syntactic phenomena: case marking, the shift from prepositions to preverbs, and reanalysis. Based on these features, I show that the AVS developed out of the reanalysis of reflexive markers into markers of intransitivity and out of prepositions incorporated into the verb complex; these two different sources of voice marking explain why the morphological exponents of different voices are differently positioned in the verb form. The proposed reconstruction straightforwardly accounts for a number of AVS properties, including the prominence of arguments promoted to subject position, the Subject-Only Restriction, the existence of various peripheral functions of the voice affixes, the placement of the affixes, asymmetries in their functions, and tendencies in the later development. The historical analysis also has implications beyond Austronesian, in allowing us to to explain the cross-linguistic distribution of adpositions and preverbs and to capture the descriptive facts of a similar morphosyntactic system outside Austronesian: the voice system in Dinka.',\n",

As this nicknaming process is mainly applied to female names, it is speculated that /h/ alternates with [p] to express cuteness, regardless of the surrounding contexts. This study ran an experiment that examines whether the singleton [p] is more likely to offer an image of cuteness than other consonants that can be used in Japanese. The results show that the singleton [p] is most likely to be associated with cuteness.\\r\\n     Additionally, this study focuses on the orthographic Lyman’s Law, or OCP (diacritic), which can be defined as a constraint that prohibits two auxiliary signs from occurring in a word (Kawahara in press). In Japanese orthography, voiced obstruents (da = “だ”; ga = “が”; za = “ざ”; ba = “ば”) are expressed with a diacritical sign called a dakuten (``), and [p] (pa = “ぱ”) with a diacritical sign called a han-dakuten (°). When this fact is taken into consideration, OCP (diacritic) will prevent the singleton [p] to occur with voiced obstruents in a word. OCP (diacritic) has more explanatory power than the traditional Lyman’s Law, in the sense that it can predict the singleton [p] as well as voiced obstruents to induce the devoicing of voiced geminates (Fukazawa et al. 2015; Kawahara & Sano 2016b). The current study focuses on testing the constraint that forbids the singleton [p] to precede a voiced obstruent (i.e. [p…D], in which D denotes a voice obstruent), making use of the new nicknaming phenomenon showing /h/→[p] alternation. The experiment also examines whether the nicknaming formation can be affected by OCP-related conditions across morpheme boundaries or within a word, such as Identity Avoidance (e.g., Kawahara & Sano 2014a, 2016a; Kumagai & Kawahara 2017a) and OCP-labial effect (Kumagai 2017). The conclusion drawn by the second experiment is that *[p…D] is psychologically real in the minds of Japanese speakers, and that the /h/→[p] alternation in the new nicknames created is more likely to cease in OCP-related conditions.',\n",

       "  \"This thesis examines weight effects on stress and proposes a probabilistic approach based on the notion that weight is gradient, not categorical. Arguments for this proposal are divided into three main chapters, which examine and statistically model weight in the lexicon (Chapter 1), weight in the grammar (Chapter 2), and the interaction of weight and footing (Chapter 3). The statistical analyses in Chapters 2 and 3 also discuss how our linguistic expectations regarding weight effects can be incorporated in statistical models through the use of mildly informative priors, and to what extent the fit of such models compare with that of models based on non-informative priors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 1, I examine weight effects in the Portuguese lexicon, and show that they are considerably more intricate than what is assumed in the literature. Previous weight-based studies consider that weight only affects stress in word-final syllables, and that weight is categorical (e.g., Bisol 1992, Lee 2007). In other words, syllables in Portuguese are traditionally classified as heavy or light.\\r\\nI show that weight should not be seen as categorical. By exploring a comprehensive lexicon (Houaiss et al. 2001), I demonstrate that heavy syllables have a gradient effect on stress. This effect is modulated by the position of a given heavy syllable in the stress domain as well as its segmental count. This entails that weight effects are not restricted to word-final syllables. Rather, all syllables in the stress domain present some weight effect on stress. One such effect is in fact puzzling: antepenultimate light syllables are more stress-attracting than antepenultimate heavy syllables. This contradicts the typology of weight and stress, since heavy syllables are not expected to repel stress in weight-sensitive languages (Gordon 2006). Given the non-categorical patterns observed in the lexicon, I propose a probabilistic approach to stress in the language. To demonstrate the empirical advantage of such an approach, I show that the accuracy of probabilistic predictions is substantially higher than that of categorical predictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 2, I examine to what extent these lexical patterns in Portuguese are captured by speakers' grammars. First, I show that speakers do generalise the weight gradience in the lexicon to novel words. The effects monotonically weaken as we move away from the right edge of the word, which mirrors what is found in the lexicon (Chapter 1). Second, I show that speakers do not generalise the typologically contradictory pattern found in antepenultimate syllables in the lexicon. Instead, speakers assign positive weight effects to all syllables in the stress domain; i.e., they repair the negative weight effect in question. Previous findings in the literature on phonological (under)learning have shown that unnatural (or contradictory) patterns are harder to learn, and are often ignored by speakers (e.g., Hayes and Londe 2006, Hayes et al. 2009, Becker et al. 2011, Becker et al. 2012). Chapter 2 shows that speakers can go beyond ignoring such patterns: they can in fact repair them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe probabilistic approach presented in Chapters 1 and 2 raises the question of how footing impacts stress in a language such as Portuguese, where weight effects are gradient. Indeed, a non-categorical weight-based approach poses important challenges to footing. In Chapter 3, I argue that Portuguese does not offer compelling evidence for the foot. First, the gradient weight effects found in the lexicon and in speakers' behaviour cannot be captured with any foot type, given that even antepenultimate stress is directly affected by weight. Second, no phonological process (e.g., truncation, reduplication, hypocorisation) makes reference to the foot. Third, different foot types have been proposed across the literature because of contradictory patterns of stress location---patterns which are mirrored in truncation, reduplication, and hypocorisation in the language. Fourth, subminimal words are not only common in the Portuguese lexicon, but are also productive in the language.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the evidence against footing in Portuguese is compelling, and I therefore conclude that the language does not have feet. To further strengthen this argument, I turn to English, where the evidence for footing is robust. Even though English and Portuguese present similar stress patterns on the surface, I show that these two languages are fundamentally different. Unlike in Portuguese, stress patterns in the English lexicon and in speakers' grammars exhibit weight effects that are predicted if one assumes moraic trochees and extrametricality in the language (e.g., Hayes 1982). The probabilistic weight-based approach to stress adopted in this thesis thus concludes that feet are parametric (following, e.g., Özçelik (2013, 2014)), and are therefore present in English, but absent in Portuguese.\",\n",

Rather than propose novel mechansims or complicate the notion of Merge, I propose that HM be rethought of as Feature Geometry growth. Taking seriously the idea that syntactic heads are merely feature bundles organized into a geometry, I propose that these feature bundles can merge, forming larger feature geometries. The feature geometry thus formed must be consistent with the overall feature geometry of the language in question. Just as intervening features in a Feature Geometry cannot be missing, HM cannot skip intervening heads, thus deriving the Head Movement Constraint. This theory of HM is illustrated in depth with negation in English, resolving some thorny issues left unsettled under the traditional theory of HM. Some tentative remarks are made regarding noun incorporation and Long Head Movement. The paper concludes with a discussion of the advantages of the proposed theory of the traditional theory of HM and with some unresolved issues.',\n",

The first auxiliary is described as expressing 'full completion' of the event, but its use is highly restricted, to events with incremental or universally quantified themes. Using targeted context-based elicitation, we find that the expression of completion is indirect.  Instead, the auxiliary asserts that the event description is homomorphic--- all of its events are both event-mapped and theme-mapped.  Homomorphism requires every part of the theme to undergo a part of the event, and this derives the reported sense of completion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second auxiliary is not attested in the literature. It applies to all kinds of events, and adds the conventional implicature that the event as described satisfies some salient propositional content by rendering it true.  For instance, it makes part of a plan come to fruition.  This plan is presupposed, and the content is accessible through a content-generating function.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe apply the methodologies of formal semantic fieldwork to tease these auxiliaries apart, including scope tests that apply differently to the two auxiliaries.

As a modifier, plural –tul bears the privative feature [plural], rather than the binary feature [±plural] reserved for a plural that realizes a head. Supporting evidence comes from the fact that the presence of –tul leads to an obligatorily plural reading, while a number-neutral reading obtains in its absence; –tul also shows no evidence of inflectional properties. Appearing as an adjunct to nP, –tul shows certain idiosyncrasies, such as irregularities in the range of nouns that it can occur with. Evidence against the common claim that –tul is associated with a definite reading is provided, which suggests that it cannot realize D or adjoin to DP. The major consequence of this paper is that the often observed non-co-occurrence of classifiers and plural markers is predicted only when the relation between the two morphemes is in syntactic complementary distribution, but may not be when the relation is in merely semantic complementary distribution.

We argue that pro-speech gestures can trigger several types of inferences besides entailments: presuppositions and anti-presuppositions (derived from Maximize Presupposition), scalar implicatures and 'Blind Implicatures', homogeneity inferences that are characteristic of definite plurals, and some expressive inferences that are characteristic of pejorative terms.

We show in each case that we are not dealing with a translation into spoken language because the fine-grained meanings obtained are tied to the iconic properties of the gestures.

In this paper, we investigate two sluicing strategies in Spoken Tamil, namely case-marked (CM) and non-case-marked (NCM) sluicing. In addition to the morphological distinction with respect to the presence/absence of grammatical case on the wh-sluice, we argue that the two types of sluicing differ in the configuration of the underlying embedded CP. For CM sluicing, the sluiced clause is derived from a full-fledged interrogative CP at the underlying level, whereas the bare wh-sluice undergoes leftward wh-scrambling to the CP-initial position followed by TP-domain deletion at PF. While we contend that most A/A’-diagnostics are uninformative of the type of operation wh-scrambling in Tamil involves (contra Sarma (2003)), various properties of the CM wh-sluice (e.g. scope, negation, adverb placement, multiple sluicing) can still be described by postulating that the wh-sluice involves A’-scrambling. For the second type of sluicing (NCM sluicing), the sluiced clause involves a biclausal structure formed by a normal sentence and a null copular question. We claim that the NCM wh-sluice is derived from Spad (Sluicing Plus A Demonstrative), since the null copular question can be accompanied by a demonstrative, cf. English ‘John met someone, who is that?’ and Dutch spading (Van Craenenbroeck 2010). Spad is not derived from a full-fledged interrogative CP, and therefore its wh-sluice does not involve any scrambling operation. The present analysis of Tamil sluicing refutes the claim that reduced clefts are one underlying sluicing source in Dravidian languages, and moreover invites an inquiry of whether Dravidian as a language family in the historical sense always receives a homogeneous analysis, given the immense parametric variation among branch languages. In the same vein, we contend that any claim about the ‘principles’ of Dravidian syntax must be supported by strong cross-linguistic evidence at the microscopic level.',\n",

I show based on novel data from ECM constructions and passives and unaccusatives, that it is not the syntactic position which restricts the distribution of men-type pronouns, but it is case. English type pronouns can occur with multiple cases, but can only have a generic inclusive reading. All Dutch type pronouns can only occur with nominative case and can have multiple impersonal readings. Moreover, I show that Dutch and Swedish allow an existential reading when the pronoun is a derived subject (contra Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003)) I will account for this correlation between the different readings and case by assuming different feature make-ups for the pronouns, following Egerland (2003), Hoekstra (2010), Ackema and Neeleman (2016): 'one' has phi features and therefore always needs to be obligatorily inclusive; 'men' lacks this functional layer too and therefore has no restriction on its readings. Moreover, I propose that since men lacks a phi-layer, it is too deficient to project a KP, and therefore it can only occur with unmarked nominative case.\",\n",

Second, I demonstrate an equivalence of the resulting theory with a variable-free semantics, one which extends both to the combinatory apparatus underwriting composition, and to the resulting semantic values.',\n",

Temporal inversion occurs irrespective of the verb being transitive or intransitive, whereas locative inversion is limited to contexts with an intransitive verb. This research argues that this distinction correlates with the base-generation of temporal/locative adjuncts; temporal adjuncts are base-generated adjoining TP, whereas locatives are base-generated adjoining VP. Temporal but not locative adjuncts resist fronting with vP, demand the use of a tense copula (or a tensed verb), and are not subject to deletion along with the lexical verb. With the assumption that Spec, SubjP must be filled by a non-silent copy due to the effects of Subject Criterion (Rizzi and Shlonsky 2007), a temporal or locative adjunct, if any, fills this position instead of the extracted thematic subject. Given its low position, a locative adjunct is accessible to Subj0 only when there is no v*P, hence the account of the correlation between locative inversion and verb valency. Furthermore, this research explores existence of temporal/locative inversion in other two Arabic dialects, arguing for a micro-parametric view of this strategy across Arabic dialects.    ',\n",

I argue that such empirical patterns fall out of general compositional principles so long as type-shifting operators are available to the compositional system.  I begin by weighing in on some long-standing issues in the semantic analysis of Tagalog bare NPs. I show that bare NPs which are thematic patients are interpreted as presuppositional definites if marked with nominative case and as narrow scope indefinites if marked with genitive case. Bare NPs are analyzed as basically predicative. If a bare NP is local to its selecting verb, such as a genitive case-marked patient, it is existentially quantified over by the verb itself, generating an indefinite interpretation. If a bare NP moves to a derived position, it must type-shift in order to avoid a type-mismatch, generating a definite interpretation. \\r\\n This paper explains how a grammatical system like Tagalog's, which lacks articles but demonstrates other morphosyntactic strategies for signaling (in)definiteness, can be integrated into our understanding of compositional semantics.\",\n",

Language-specific evidence in favor of such structure of alternative questions is available for Ossetic as well. Accordingly, the ostensible disjuncts coffee or tea do not actually form a constituent and case must be separately assigned to each of the DPs.

For example, given the context that the interval of permitted speed is between 35 and 50 mph, the sentence 'Lucinda is driving less fast than allowed' is ambiguous between two readings: (i) her speed is below the minimum (i.e., 35 mph); (ii) her speed is below the maximum (i.e., 50 mph). Previously, this ambiguity has been attributed to either the scopal interaction between a negation element and a modal (Heim 2006a) or the optional application of a silent operator (Crnicˇ 2017). Here we show that these two lines of accounts under- or over-generate. Instead, we propose that the source of this ambiguity is located in the ambiguous answerhood for wh-questions corresponding to this kind of than-clauses (e.g., how fast is Lucinda allowed to drive). The current proposal consists of three parts. First, based on Zhang & Ling 2015, 2017a,b, we adopt a generalized interval-arithmetic-based recipe for computing the semantics of comparatives. Second, the semantics of than-clauses is considered equal to that of short answers to corresponding wh-questions. Third, since the use of existential priority modals in wh-questions leads to the ‘mention-some/mention-all’ ambiguity for answerhood, we propose that this ambiguity projects in further derivation and leads to the two readings for comparatives like the Lucinda sentence.\",\n",

This defence is particularly relevant given that even Chierchia himself (2010) rejects the underlying semantics that is essential to Chierchia 1998’s explanation.

Depending on specific theories, imperatives inherently contain an illocutionary operator with directive force (e.g., Han1998, 1999a/b/c, 2001), a performative necessity modal similar to MUST/SHOULD (e.g., Schwager 2005a, 2005b, 2006; as Kaufmann 2012), or may denote an addressee-restricted property that constitutes a full commitment (e.g., Portner 2005, 2003a/b; 2007; Ninan 2005;Condoravdi & Lauer 2010, 2011, 2012; among others). Despite the fact that imperatives cannot be simply identified with a single label of modality (i.e., necessity, possibility, deontic, bouletic, teleological etcetera), I propose that there is indeed an underlying property shared by all imperatives unifying and distinguishing them from declaratives: they contribute a nonveridical modal space. In this paper, I study imperatives in terms of nonveridicality and polar partition and argue that their semantic contribution is the presupposition of epistemic uncertainty as to the actualization of a proposition p and the creation of nonveridical modal spaces. Imperatives introduce a preference ordering between p and non-p worlds, and are analyzed as nonveridical operators conveying partial certainty and no inherent directive force. Under this perspective, it is not unexpected that imperative manifests not only as a verbal morphology, but also in the form of particles, i.e., the subjunctive imperatives with na particle in Greek, or that imperatives function modally since nonveridicality characterizes all modalities. Therefore, the dilemma whether imperatives are modals or not becomes redundant; it only matters that imperatives induce nonveridical modal spaces.',\n",

       "  \"ASL (American Sign Language) can express plurals by repeating a noun, in an unpunctuated fashion, in different parts of signing space. We argue that this construction may come with a rich (and at-issue) iconic component: the geometric arrangement of the repetitions provides information about the arrangement of the denoted plurality; in addition, the number and speed of the repetitions provide information about the size of the denoted plurality. Interestingly, the shape of the repetitions may introduce a new singular discourse referents when a vertex can be inferred to denote a singular object. Thus one may point towards the first or last iteration of a horizontal repetition of BOOK to denote the left- or right-edge of the corresponding row. This yields a remarkable interaction between iconic semantics and standard logical semantics.  We show that our analysis extends to 'punctuated' repetitions, which involve clearly individuated iterations of a singular noun. While these may initially look like coordinated indefinites, they are better handled by the same iconic framework as plural, unpunctuated repetitions. Some repetition-based mass terms also give rise to iconic effects, and to different readings depending on whether the repetition is continuous, unpunctuated, or punctuated.  Our analysis highlights the need for a formal semantics with iconicity to study the integration of such iconic and logical conditions. It also raises a question: can similar facts be found in spoken language when gestures are taken into account?  We suggest that most effects can be replicated, especially when one considers examples involving 'pro-speech gestures' (= gestures that fully replace some spoken expressions).\",\n",

The properties and internal chronology of these changes are of great theoretical relevance to elucidate issues on the architecture of grammar and the place and form of parametric variation. In this paper we argue that standard non-derivational approaches to dative alternations, which assume that the agreement/agreementless alternation reflects a new situation where an \\r\\nemerging adpositional construction coexists with an independent applicative strategy, fail to account for important generalizations concerning the interaction of the changes. Instead, a derivational approach based on the incorporation of an adpositional head accounts naturally for the distribution of facts and conforms to the properties of dative variation crosslinguistically.\\r\\nFollowing the same line, we also argue for a revision of the \"High/Low Applicatives\" distinction that approaches them to the situation of subjects, where elements of a very different origin occupy the same structural position.',\n",

For a scenario in which a boy eats some but not all cookies, some speakers regard the sentence as a truthful description of the scenario, while other speakers do not. In other words, only the former accepts the wide scope reading of negation (the not>every reading). One hypothesis of this fact is that each group of speakers has a different grammar, where the distinction rests on whether the verb moves to T or not; this is Han et al.\\'s (2007) two-grammar hypothesis. Certain theories of the syntax-phonology interface (e.g. Samuels 2011) predict that the grammatical split should be accompanied by a phonological split. Specifically, the prediction is that the Post-Obstruent Tensing process in Korean for speakers who reject the not>every reading should be blocked from applying between the transitive verb and the object of a simple declarative sentence. A two-part experiment composed of a truth-value judgment task and a production task was conducted to test the prediction. The result reproduced the findings of Han et al.

Furthermore, I discuss how this approach can extend to similar data from Afrikaans, Dutch and English, as well as to split topicalization constructions in German.

After a systematic review of linguistic profiles targeting mainly English-, Greek-, Catalan-, and Spanish-speaking populations with developmental disorders (n = 880), shared loci of impairment are identified and certain domains of grammar are shown to be more vulnerable than others. The distribution of impaired loci is captured by the Locus Preservation Hypothesis which suggests that specific parts of the language faculty are immune to impairment across developmental disorders. Through the Locus Preservation Hypothesis, a classical chicken and egg question can be addressed: Do poor conceptual resources and memory limitations result in an atypical grammar or does a grammatical breakdown lead to conceptual and memory limitations? Overall, certain morphological markers reveal themselves as highly susceptible to impairment, while syntactic operations are preserved, granting support to the first scenario. The origin of resilient syntax is explained from a phylogenetic perspective in connection to the “syntax-before-phonology” hypothesis.',\n",

We argue that, despite appearances, comparative quantifiers do not provide evidence for reconstruction, and in fact offer new evidence against it. We then provide another argument against reconstruction in tough-constructions based on special syntactic positions that independently require reconstruction. The picture that emerges is thus remarkably cohesive in that a considerable range of disparate evidence converges on the anti-reconstruction property of tough-constructions. We then consider some of the theoretical consequences of this conclusion and argue that the available evidence supports the base-generation analysis of tough-constructions over movement accounts. Specifically, we present arguments against Fleisher's (2013) suggestion that anti-reconstruction also follows from Hicks' (2009) smuggling version of the movement account.\",\n",

Vowel tensing is a strategy to enhance the distinctiveness of vowel contrasts. The two strategies conflict to determine vowel quality in vowel-consonant sequences and language variation results from different ways of solving this conflict in grammars with constraints on contrasts.

In this paper I present evidence from Nez Perce (Sahaptian) that this prediction is false. In Nez Perce applicative unaccusatives, the theme argument raises over the applicative argument and is accordingly marked with the ergative case. Nez Perce thus demonstrates raising to ergative. Building on Baker's (2014) study of similar phenomena in Shipibo (Panoan), I argue that apparently nonlocal movement of the theme in the raising-to-ergative pattern involves not a covert adpositional structure, but rather a response to independently motivated constraints on antilocal movement and remnant movement.\",\n",

Ideally, as the resolution mechanism is implemented in terms of an agreement mechanism initiated within the &P, it should draw on tools of feature-based computation found elsewhere in the grammar. However, &P-internal agreement is unique within the grammar in that the two participating goals (namely, each conjunct) are equidistant from the &P head in question (assuming it is specified as needing to probe twice). As a result, existing mechanisms such as Multiple Agree (Hiraiwa, 2001, Anagnostopoulou, 2005), which are based on one goal being hierarchically higher than the other, and employed in accounts such as the Person-Case Constraint, are inapplicable. Instead, the closest grammatical parallels to an agreement mechanism with equidistant goals are found in phonology, and it will be proposed that precisely such a mechanism is shared in these two domains, even though they instantiate distinct modules of the grammar. As such, the analysis offered in this paper instantiates a case of Crossmodular Structural Parallelism, a hypothesis about the reuse of operations such as featural agreement, featural deletion, and feature co-occurrence constraints across domains of morphosyntactic and phonological features, and one that has been a fruitful part of linguistic theory throughout the work of Andrea Calabrese (e.g. Calabrese 1998) and many works inspired by it.',\n",

The overall theme of the dissertation is an exploration into the interaction of questions and doxastic domains, set within formal syntactic, semantic and pragmatic theories. The main empirical focus is the South Asian (Indo Aryan; India, Bangladesh) language Bangla (also known as Bengali), which is analyzed based on the native speaker judgements of the author, as well as several surveys collected from other native speakers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interaction of perspectival elements with speech acts have been a relatively under-explored area of study. I undertake the study of evidentials (elements marking an agent's source of information). I argue for a theory that is both syntax and semantics informed. In particular, I propose that evidentials crucially take only finite clauses as complements, and derive their interpretation from a `judge' that is syntactically represented in the left periphery, and that interacts with other perspectival heads both inside the finite clause as well as the speech-act projection. This approach enables a unified analysis of the Bangla evidential 'naki', that changes its evidential flavor based on its syntactic position. In the interpretative component, I argue that evidentials embody either Involved (committed) or Uninvolved (not committed) sources of information. I propose that the world's evidentials come in two shapes: those that effect Interrogative Flip (shifting of perspective from the speaker to addressee in questions) and those that do not, and I locate the difference in a formal semantic property. This formal property predicts the presence or absence of bias in questions with evidentials, and forges a cross-linguistic link between evidentiality and bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second focus of the dissertation is alternative questions and disjunction. The main claim offered is that there is a crucial connection between interrogative and 'whether' in Bangla: they are underlying the same element 'kina'. The surface differences between the two constructions is shown to be derivable from the syntactic processes of head movement and ellipsis. This unification claim has not been undertaken for any other language in the literature. I argue that this claim is also semantically viable, and propose an Alternative Semantics-theoretic analysis that can explain the presence of 'kina' (`whether') in Bangla alternative questions. This analysis, while focussed on Bangla, also makes predictions in an area that is understudied in the world's languages - the interrogative-boolean divide within the universal disjunction space. I undertake a comparative study with Mandarin Chinese, and investigate the locus of the divide in the two languages. This study fits into the overall theme of the dissertation by furthering the understanding of Bangla questions and their interaction with other domains such as disjunction and perspective-sensitivity, as viewed from the standpoint of the syntax-semantics-pragmatic interfaces.\",\n",

I evaluate current theories of AA paying special attention to Baier (2017b, 2017c)’s morphological account of AA. I propose that this theory requires morphology to have information that the syntactic component does not have even in a feature-sharing approach to AGREE (Frampton & Gutmann 2000). As such I argue that AA is decided in the syntax and occurs when a head fails to copy any of the features of a potential goal including any phi-features that may be needed for valuation. I formalize this account in OT, following Erlewine (2016) and show how it can be extended to account for what Baier (2017c) calls partial AA.\",\n",

       "  'This dissertation proposes a unified theory of Place Identity to model interactions of phonological place features along local, long-distance, and input/output dimensions. Empirical support comes from reduction and agreement processes involving complex, or multiple, place on a single segment---processes previously reported to be unattested. Identity constraints (Ident and Agree) are those that demand two segments be alike with respect to the presence or value of some feature, and are constructed here following a schema of Generalized Identity. The resulting constraints vary both in the relation of the segments in question (input/output correspondence, surface correspondence, or strict adjacency) and in the location of place features in the geometry (within-category or cross-category). Sets of stringently-defined constraints are built via Constraint Summation, a constraint-building operation that sums the violation profiles of the original constraints. The resulting system of place identity captures partial class effects (based on Padgett 2002) of place along all identity dimensions, while augmenting the observations in de Lacy 2006 on markedness reduction and inventory structure with respect to complex segments. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpirical investigation of complex segments reveals place behavior unattested with simple stops. In Ngbaka, place co-occurrence restrictions are an example of long-distance major place harmony, which requires place identity over surface correspondence in the Agreement by Correspondence framework (Rose & Walker 2004, a.o.). The patterns are supported by a statistical analysis of a newly-digitized Ngbaka dictionary. Additionally, in Vietnamese and Aghem, a back, round vowel causes a change in consonantal place on an adjacent consonant, forming a labial-velar stop in both instances. This otherwise unattested type of cross-category interaction provides additional evidence for a unified theory of place features (following Clements & Hume 1995), to which place identity constraints crucially refer. Lastly, complex segments shed a place feature when undergoing markedness reduction instead of reducing to the least marked place (cf. de Lacy 2006). These processes are supported by an empirical survey, and show that place identity must count each place disparity. The resulting grammatical system is powerful enough to determine targets of reduction for complex segments without additional representational devices while restrictive enough to not overgenerate patterns for simple place reduction.

This article presents a previously unattested variant of the PCC found in Slovenian, where the canonical PCC operates alongside a REVERSE PCC, where the restriction applies to the IO. This pattern is not predicted by standard syntactic approaches to the PCC (which rely on inherent asymmetries between the IO and DO). It is argued that the PCC (in all its forms) arises with pronouns that are inherently unspecified for a person value and need to receive it externally from a functional head via Agree. The structurally higher pronoun blocks the structurally lower pronoun from receiving a person value, giving rise to the PCC. The REVERSE PCC then arises due to optional DO-over-IO clitic movement prior to person valuation. The proposed analysis is shown to capture cross-linguistic variation regarding the PCC including the STRONG/WEAK PCC split, which is attributed to a variation in the structure of pronouns. The article also establishes a cross-linguistic typology of the REVERSE PCC, where the REVERSE PCC exists exclusively as an optional pattern alongside the baseline PCC pattern.',\n",

I argue that complete dominance plays a crucial role in the resolution of two puzzles: The right-edge restriction on right-node raising and selective island effects in A’-movement. I develop a linearization algorithm which is locally sensitive to complete dominance, and show how, when applied to right-node raising structures, it predicts the right-edge effect. I also explore how, following Bachrach & Katzir (2009, 2017), complete dominance plays a role in cyclic Spellout. Bachrach & Katzir argue that PF Spellout of incompletely dom- inated material is delayed. I extend Bachrach & Katzir’s delayed Spellout model to both PF and LF, and show how, when combined with Johnson’s (2012, 2014) model of movement, it predicts the range of selective island effects (Cinque 1990, Postal 1998).

The generalisation says that in the linear sequence DATIVE—ALLATIVE—LOCATIVE, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features A, AB and B respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the “overlapping” decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.',\n",

The particles are shown to be heads in the C-domain with topic-marking function. It is shown that the topics typology put forward by Frascarelli and Hinterhölzl (2007) for German and Italian extends to NHA. The Shifting Topic (S-Topic) is situated above the Focus Phrase, followed by Contrastive Topic (C-Topic), which is in turn followed by Familiar Topic (F-Topic). S-Topic can be marked by either C-particles mar or ʕad.  \\r\\nThe particles tara and ʔaktɪn mark an entity expressing C-Topic, while the particle ʁedɪ, tsin, ʔeʃwa and tigil mark an entity expressing F-Topic. All particles are argued to carry a valued [TOP] feature. However, they are different with respect to whether they have φ-content. This difference motivates the distinction between agreeing particles (having φ-content) and nonagreeing particles (not having φ-content). The study shows that the agreeing particles are probes, being with unvalued φ-features, establishing an Agree relation (Chomsky 2000, 2001) with the element that carries a matching unvalued [TOP] feature and valued φ-features. This results in the valuation of the unvalued φ-features of the agreeing particle, and the valuation of the matching unvalued [TOP] feature of the goal. As a result, the topic interpretation is achieved via the chain created by the head of the topic and the topicalized item. The study shows that when the goal has φ-content, an inflectional suffix expressing the same φ-content as that of the goal is suffixed to the particle.  \\r\\nThe motivation behind counting the [TOP] feature on the goal to be unvalued comes from the cases where the goal is the object. NHA data show that the object moves to a position where it gets accessible to the probe, the agreeing particle, following Chomsky (2000, 2001), Bošković (2007, 2014) and Holmberg et al. (2017). This is consistent in the case with multiple topics, where the two topics, the subject and the object, tuck in the projecting headed by the particle (Richards 1997, 1999).  \\r\\nAs for the non-agreeing particles, the study argues that, instead of φ-content, these heads are endowed with an [EPP] feature, which attracts the element carrying the matching unvalued [TOP] feature to the Spec position of the relevant head. This accounts for why such particles cannot be clause-initial. These facts motivate the assumption that movement to the left periphery (i.e. topicalization) is forced when the head of the Topic Phrase is not endowed with any φ-content.',\n",

Since Higgins (1973) four semantically distinct types of copular clauses have been recognized in the literature, i.e. predicational, equative, specificational, and identificational clauses. There are many proposals aiming to reduce the number of copular clause types via collapsing certain types into others. This dissertation contributes to the debate by providing novel evidence from Czech that identificational clauses are predicational and specificational clauses are inverted predicational or equative clauses. Czech provides an excellent tool to investigate copular clauses for three reasons: (i) rich phi-feature agreement, (ii) case alternation, (iii) analytical verbal morphology. Using the three properties Czech offers, I argue that specificational clauses are derived via scrambling of a structurally lower NP over a structurally higher NP. Consequently, I support the inversion analysis of specificational clauses (Moro, 1997; Den Dikken, 2006; Mikkelsen, 2006; Heycock, 2012, a.o.). I also argue that specificational clauses may be derived from both, predicational and equative clauses. In contrast, identificational clauses, despite their initial resemblance to specificational clauses, are argued not to involve inversion, therefore providing empirical support for Heller and Wolter (2008). I also present novel empirical data from Czech that show that the interpretation of the pronoun in identificational clauses is restricted by the copular agreement. In order to account for the restriction, I argue that both NPs in identificational clauses Agree with the copula via a Multiple-Agree chain (see Hiraiwa (2005)).',\n",

Following substantial work on the interaction of voicing and nasality (Nasukawa 1997, 2005; Ploch 1999; Botma 2004) it is commonly assumed that voicing and nasality are both represented by the same prime |L|, with dependent |L| encoding nasality and headed |_L_| encoding voicing. In this paper I counter some of the arguments for the universality of this implementation, and develop an alternative view of a unified voicing–nasality prime, in which voicing is encoded by dependent |L| and nasality by headed |_L_|. I show how this analysis is more consistent with both the saliency and strength arguments by considering arguments based on the represented acoustic patterns, positional strength, nasal sharing (nasal harmony within onset–nucleus pairs), and cross-linguistic biases against loss of nasality. Finally, I show how this account is compatible with a more restrictive, recursive view of the phonological interpretation component following the set theoretic model of Element Theory in Breit (2013). Based on these arguments I conclude that we have good reason to doubt the universality of Nasukawa (1997, 2005) and Ploch’s (1999) implementation; instead we must give serious consideration to the reverse option with headed |L| for nasality and dependent |L| for voicing. I suggest that there are two possible responses to this situation: we can either make the attempt to radically adopt the alternative, or we can adopt a more relativistic position (in the sense of Cyran 2011, 2014) which allows a choice between both options.',\n",

Rendaku is a process by which the first consonant of the second member of a compound becomes voiced (e.g., /oo/ + /tako/  => [oo+dako] \"big octopus\"). Lyman\\'s Law blocks rendaku when the second member already contains a voiced obstruent (/oo/ + /tokage/ => *[oo+dokage], [oo+tokage] \"big lizard\"). Lyman\\'s Law, as a constraint which prohibits a morpheme with two voiced obstruents, is also known to trigger devoicing of geminates in loanwords (e.g. /beddo/ => [betto] \"bed\").

Inspired by recent work that shows the interplay between orthographic factors and grammatical factors in shaping our phonological behaviors, this paper proposes that rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law actually operate on Japanese orthography. Rendaku is a process that assigns dakuten diacritics, and Lyman\\'s Law prohibits morphemes with two diacritics. The paper shows that a set of properties of rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law follow from this proposal. However, since some aspects of rendaku and Lyman\\'s Law are undoubtedly phonological, the ultimate conclusion is that it is most fruitful to recognize a model of phonology in which it has access to orthographic information.

       "  'Given the wealth of literature on anaphora within the generative tradition, it is surprising, if not downright odd, that the question of what an anaphor formally is, still remains very much unresolved. This paper seeks to tackle this problem head on and find a fruitful resolution for it. Two main schools of thought can be discerned: one holds that anaphors are defined as being deficient for phi-features; the other, that they are deficient for some non-phi feature, F. The main source of the problem, I argue, is that there are strong theoretical and empirical arguments for both views on anaphora. Morphological underspecification, phi-matching effects, and the Anaphor Agreement Effect (AAE) provide evidence supporting a phi-deficiency approach. Perspectival anaphora, and deep-rooted anaphoric sensitivity to person-hierarchy effects reflected in PCC effects, agreement, and a seldom noticed typological gap for person in anaphoric antecedence (but see Comrie 1999), argue in favor of the other view. The upshot of all this, is that we have two mutually inconsistent but valid views on anaphora. There is no single anaphor that can satisfy the criteria for both at the same time. I thus propose that anaphors in natural language be categorized into distinct featural classes and delineate what this looks like against a binary feature system for person, enriched with a privative animacy feature. The current model is shown to make accurate empirical predictions with respect with respect to anaphors that are insensitive to person-asymmetry effects for the PCC, to animacy effects for anaphoric agreement, and to a special case of non-ϕ-matching between the anaphor and its binder.\\r\\n\\r\\n(New version: much more compact and has some new data with respect to the 1/2 vs. 3 antecedence gap).',\n",

As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003196 for the related corpus study.

This analysis is compared to that of Alderete (1999, 2001), who argues that Cupeño shows accentual root faithfulness — i.e., that the accentual properties of roots are privileged over non-root morphemes. I show that the BAP analysis is both simpler and attains greater empirical coverage than the root faithfulness analysis, which fails to account for certain attested stress patterns that are captured under the BAP analysis. Thus reanalyzed, Cupeño has two important typological implications. First, without support from Cupeño, root faithfulness may be unattested as a feature of lexical accent systems. Second, Cupeño provides a clear typological parallel for the ancient IE languages on the basis of which the BAP was posited — in particular, Vedic Sanskrit — as well as for Hittite, where I argue that it is also operative. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis of Hittite stress advanced in this dissertation is the first systematic attempt at a synchronic generative treatment of its word stress patterns. Having established that stress\\r\\nassignment in Hittite inflection is governed by the BAP, I also adduce evidence for accentual\\r\\ndominance — i.e., morphemes whose accentual specification “overrides” the BAP. I propose that accentual dominance in Hittite is a consequence of morphological headedness: the lexical\\r\\naccent of the word’s head morpheme is privileged in Hittite, just as Revithiadou (1999) has\\r\\nargued for other lexical accent systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, this dissertation addresses the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word-prosodic system. Hittite and the other Anatolian languages are not traditionally viewed as important sources for the reconstruction of this system; however, I contend that the BAP is reconstructible for PIE and that — against this traditional view — this reconstruction depends\\r\\ncrucially on the Anatolian evidence, which converges with Vedic Sanskrit in this respect.',\n",

       "  'This paper focuses on subject extraction in Māori, the indigenous Polynesian language of New Zealand. Māori has a range of verbal and non-verbal predicate constructions. I argue that, whilst subject topicalisation is generally permitted in all constructions, subject questioning is restricted (see Bauer 1993, 1997). More specifically, I claim that subject questioning is permitted in verbal and prepositional predicate constructions, but prohibited in nominal predicate constructions, all else being equal (see also de Lacy 1999). I review two existing types of analysis to account for this, which I refer to as the cleft + headless relative clause analysis and the complementary distribution analysis, pointing out various issues before proposing a novel analysis. I propose that Māori questions are cleft structures but ones where the embedded clause is a focus construction rather than a relative clause (see Belletti 2008, 2012, 2015). I also propose that subject questioning is prohibited in nominal predicate constructions due to intervention by the nominal predicate phrase. My analysis suggests that topicalisation and focus/question movement in Māori are triggered by A-features rather than A’-features. I discuss the use of A-features in formally encoding topicalisation and focus/questioning from an emergentist perspective, i.e. one where formal features are not innately pre-specified but rather emerge during language acquisition guided by the Third Factor cognitive bias to ‘Maximise Minimal Means’ (Biberauer 2017; Biberauer & Roberts 2015, 2017). *COMMENTS WELCOME!*',\n",

       "  'This dissertation provides a novel analysis of Amount Relatives (Carlson 1977, Heim 1987, Grosu & Landman 1998, Herdan 2008, Meier 2015, a.o). Amount Relatives are a form of non-intersective relative clause that is usually associated with amount interpretations . For example, the sentence it will take us the rest of our lives to drink the champagne they spilled that evening is most naturally interpreted as referring to an amount of champagne, and not any particular champagne. Previous accounts of Amount Relatives have converged in appealing to degree semantics in order to extract an amount from the relative clause, suggesting that the embedded CP denotes a property of degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dissertation advocates a more nuanced view of Amount Relatives across languages. I propose that natural languages allow two different strategies for deriving amount interpretations of relative clauses: a degree-based strategy and a degree-less strategy, where degree semantics does not come into play at all. It is argued that while some languages employ both strategies, as is the case with Spanish, languages like English only have the degree-less strategy, contra much of the previous literature. Evidence for this division comes from the fact that Amount Relatives in Spanish, but not English, pass independently-motivated diagnostics of degree-related operations (e.g. degree-quantification and degree-abstraction).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first part of the dissertation, I propose a novel means of arriving at amount interpretations for relative clauses in languages like English, which lack the degree-based strategy to derive such meanings. The account exploits the correlation between kind and amount readings of relative clauses in English, first noted by Carlson 1977. Amount Relatives in English will be argued to be a sub-case of kind-referring relative clauses and an analysis that derives amounts from (sub)kinds is presented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second, more sizable portion of the dissertation examines Amount Relatives in Spanish, which can be shown to make use of a degree-based strategy for deriving amount readings, as they do show all the hallmarks of degree constructions. Moreover, the language allows amount interpretations more readily, in more environments and with more diverse forms than languages like English. I will provide a compositional analysis of Spanish Amount Relatives in their various forms, with the goal of understanding (i) what syntactic and semantic pieces are implicated in extracting an amount from a relative clause structure and (ii) how different permutations of these pieces could result in semantic variation within and across languages.',\n",

These phenomena provide novel evidence for the Cinque hierarchy (Cinque 1999), for a syntactic distinction between sentence adverbs and predicate adverbs (Jackendoff 1972) and for an intraposition analysis of adverb extraposition (Barbiers 1995, 2001). Other findings are the syntactic defectivity of finite CP-complements of the bridge verb willen 'want. As opposed to CP-complements of denken 'think' such complements lack all layers of the Cinque hierarchy above ModVolition and they lack a ForceP layer. The analysis proposed in this paper explains why in the complement of denken 'think' only speech act adverbs can take matrix scope, while in the complement of willen 'want' only volitional adverbs can take matrix scope. It also explains why the types of adverbs that can raise overtly depend on the type of matrix bridge verb and why (partial) Wh-doubling and Neg-raising are possible with matrix verb denken but not with matrix verb willen. Finally, it explains why sentence adverbs can be extraposed while predicate adverbs cannot, and why predicate adverbs used as sentence adverbs need to be augmented with a participle or with genoeg 'enough'.\\r\\n\",\n",

Early generative approaches accounted for systematic gaps through a combination of two factors: constraints on underlying representations in the lexicon; and phonological rules. Contrasting with this view, Optimality Theory has been guided by the idea that phonological generalizations are captured not in the lexicon but rather on the surface or in the mapping from URs to surface forms. The view that there are no constraints on URs is often referred to as Richness of the Base (ROTB), and it is a central tenet of OT.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal in this note is to re-open the question of whether OT requires constraints on URs and offer a learnability argument supporting an affirmative answer, thus arguing against ROTB. We start by examining the extant literature on learning in OT and argue that the learners proposed there overgeneralize (by treating some systematic gaps as accidental), undergeneralize (by treating some accidental gaps as systematic), or both. We then discuss a different approach to learning, compression-based learning, that is the only approach currently available that can handle the data in principle without over- or undergeneralization. We show that compression-based learning learns certain naturally-occurring patterns, but crucially only if it rejects ROTB and employs language-specific constraints on URs.',\n",

We claim that (i) the mechanism for concord is uniform across the grammars of natural languages and (ii) the overt manifestation of concord is suppressed by the intervention of phasal domains. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen adjectives in a language show concord with the noun they modify, concord morphology usually involves the full set of features of that noun (e.g. gender, number and case). However, there are also languages in which concord targets only a subset of morphosyntactic features of the head noun. We observe that feature combinations that enter into concord in such languages are not random. We show that this observation can be explained with a theory of concord that has the following properties: (i) concord is obligatory whenever phasal domains are inactive (the obligatoriness claim) and (ii) languages that lack concord have phasal Noun Phrase (the phase claim). We provide evidence supporting these claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obligatoriness claim leads to two predictions: (1) idiosyncratic gender languages are gender concord languages and (2) languages with pluralia tantum nouns are plural concord languages. We show that these predictions are empirically supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phase claim implies that a language lacks overt manifestation of concord only if it has a phasal NP. We show that, due to the phasal status of NP, non-concord languages exhibit the following properties: (1) AP movement out of NP is not possible, (2) the Num head need not be obligatory in the extended projection of a noun (leading to number neutrality) and (3) nominal inflectional elements can be shared between coordinated nouns.

In Fijian, however, pronoun and proper name objects, although higher on standard DOM hierarchies, must remain verb-adjacent and are morphologically reduced. This paper shows that this pattern arises because pronoun and proper name objects undergo morphological merger with the verb at PF, which may license a nominal (Levin 2015; Branan 2017). I provide evidence that, in contrast, common noun objects in Fijian are structurally reduced, and so do not need this licensing.

Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest that the Chinese bare predicates are likely to possess a tense node with a Future/Non-Future distinction. I further suggest that Tense is a universal functional category that possesses a binary feature distinction, with a split between either Past/Non-Past or Future/Non-Future: all languages have a Tense Phrase in their hierarchical structure, although some languages lack overt marking of tense on nominals or verbs (or both). A new theory of tense is needed to account for the cross-linguistic variation on the surface form and the underlying homogeneity of temporal reference in language.

All three of these phenomena, I claim, are universally constrained by the following generalization:  No Vocabulary-Insertion rule can apply both to an unmarked core-case (nominative or absolutive) and to an inherent case (dative, instrumental, locative, etc.) without also applying to a dependent core-case (ergative or accusative).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis generalization traces back to work by Baerman et al. (2005) and Caha (2009) on syncretism, by McFadden (2014) on stem allomorphy, and by Smith et al. (2016) on suppletion. However, most of these works, albeit largely consistent with each other, invoke some or other distinctive qualification or supplementation to the general pattern. Here I argue, in contrast, that such divergences are not empirically warranted, and that the match between the patterns of the three phenomena is indeed perfect or nearly so. This argument rests, most notably, on a critique of Caha’s (2009) proposals concerning several other supposed *ABA universals in syncretisms with or among inherent cases. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext, drawing again on Caha (2009), I interpret the *ABA patterns referenced above as evidence for a containment hierarchy [[[UNMARKED] DEPENDENT] INHERENT]. I then observe that the lightest cases in this containment hierarchy, i.e. nominative and absolutive, are also the same cases that are given “elsewhere” status in Marantz’ (1991) configurational theory of case assignment. This suggests that there may be a structural economy principle at work, whereby additional case layers such as those of dependent and inherent cases may only be deployed when the lighter unmarked cases are, in a sense to be made precise, “not enough.”',\n",

       "  'This paper addresses one of the most contested issues in phonology: the derivation of phono- logical typology. I present a new model for deriving phonological typology within the Channel Bias approach. First, a new subdivision of natural processes is proposed: non-natural processes are divided into unmotivated and unnatural. The central topic of the paper is an unnatural alternation: post-nasal devoicing. I argue that in all reported cases, post-nasal devoicing does not derive from a single unnatural sound change (as claimed in some individual accounts of the data), but rather from a combination of three sound changes, each of which is natural and moti- vated. By showing that one of the rare cases of unnatural sound change reported actually arises through a combination of natural sound changes, we can maintain the long-held position that any single instance of sound change has to be natural. Based on several discussed cases, I propose a new diachronic model for explaining unnatural phenomena: the Blurring Process. Additionally, I provide a proof establishing the minimal sound changes required for an unmotivated/unnatural process to arise. The Blurring Process and Minimal Sound Change Requirement result in a model that probabilistically predicts typology within the Channel Bias approach. This paper also introduces the concept of Historical Probabilities of Alternations (Pχ) and presents a groundwork for their estimation called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. The ultimate goal of the new model is to quantify the influences of Channel Bias on phonological typology.',\n",

Even though natural language has expressions over higher types, these expressions cannot be represented as traces, which only range over individual types. I call this constraint the Trace Interpretation Constraint. The novel empirical motivation for this constraint comes from a detailed investigation of movement targeting DPs that denote properties, a kind of higher-type expression. I observe that such movement obligatorily reconstructs and argue that the absence of nonreconstructed readings entails that movement cannot map onto traces ranging over properties. This investigation is complemented by existing and novel arguments against traces ranging over generalized quantifiers, another kind of higher-type expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second core claim of this dissertation is that the Trace Interpretation Constraint cannot be circumvented by type shifting an individual-type trace into a higher type, which I call the Trace Rigidity Principle. I show that there is a class of expressions that cannot be type shifted into property denotations, namely anaphoric definite descriptions, and argue that this class of expressions properly includes traces under Trace Conversion, thereby providing independent support for the Trace Rigidity Principle. According to the Trace Interpretation Constraint and the Trace Rigidity Principle, movement is tightly restricted in how it can be semantically interpreted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dissertation also explores the dichotomy between the two representations permitted by the Trace Interpretation Constraint: leaving an individual-type trace and reconstruction. I develop a syntax and semantics of movement under which this choice is not free, but deterministic and does not require special LF interpretation rules. Therefore, a given movement derivation maps onto one and only one semantic representation. I argue that a deterministic system of movement requires multidominant representations. I demonstrate that this system of movement accounts for a number of disparate reconstruction phenomena without further ado.',\n",

In this article I argue against this hypothesis by critically reanalyzing the original arguments for PredP (coordination of unlikes, movement of the predicate, case marking on the predicate, etc.), examining whether there is any semantic support for mediated predication and reviewing the putative cross-linguistic evidence for overt equivalence of Pred0. I first demonstrate that the facts that used to be taken as requiring the presence of a functional head in small clauses can now be accounted for by independently needed assumptions, such as Raising to Object and semantic types. I then show that standard Montagovian semantics treating NPs, APs and PPs as unsaturated functions does not require a mediating projection and that alternative attempts to endow Pred0 with some interpretation either fail or cannot be used as motivation for postulating such a mediating projection. Finally, I address copular particles and other \"overt predicators\", providing evidence that their syntax is different from that expected of Pred0 in nontrivial ways, which means that they also cannot be taken as prima facie evidence for its postulation. I sketch an alternative theory linking the use of predicative particles to nominal predication and provide evidence for it from cross-linguistic lexicalization patterns of copular particles. To summarize, neither theory-internal considerations nor cross-linguistic data require the presence of a mediating functional head in small clauses, and therefore the PredP hypothesis should probably be abandoned.',\n",

This dissertation is a comprehensive examination of propositional anaphora, which I argue behaves like anaphora in other domains, is conditioned by semantic factors, and is not conditioned by purely syntactic factors nor by the at-issue status of a proposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI begin by introducing the concepts of anaphora and propositions, and then I discuss the various words of English which can have this function: this, that, it, which, so, as, and the null complement anaphor.

An important consequence of this proposal is that the point of XP ellipsis can vary depending on the derivational point where all the featural requirements of the licensor are satisfied in narrow syntax. Concerning the second research question, I suggest that ellipsis is a syntactic operation that eliminates phonological feature matrices of lexical items inside the ellipsis site, preserving the formal feature matrices. Segmental content (i.e. phonological features) is inserted into the phonological feature matrices when lexical items are sent to PF after Spell-out. This insertion does not apply to lexical items whose phonological feature matrices are eliminated, since there is no appropriate venue which segmental content is inserted into. Thus, they are not pronounced. This implies that even though narrow syntax cannot look into the information of the segmental content inside the phonological feature matrices, it can make reference to the phonological feature matrices in lexical items. This proposal is supported by the fact that elements whose phonological feature matrices have been eliminated can take part in further formal operations that occur after ellipsis, since they still contain formal features. However, unlike the other lexical items, elided interrogative wh-phrases do not seem to participate in formal operation occurring after ellipsis. In order to resolve this puzzle, I suggest a prosodic requirement questions must obey, adopting and modifying Richards’ (2016) Contiguity Theory. ',\n",

       "  'In this paper, I provide an account for the so-called Blansitt’s generalisation (Blansitt 1988). The generalisation says that in the linear sequence dative—allative—locative, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features a, ab and b respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the “overlapping” decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.',\n",

Such objects denote properties, and restrict, rather than saturate, predicates. Non-canonical objects are thus identified as event kind-classifying elements. Four properties of such objects motivate this analysis. They are never in the form of a pronoun, and never admit comparison; their hosting predicate encodes a subclass of an event kind, and the event is subject to an institutionalization constraint. Such objects are thus not arguments or adverbials. The paper further claims that since these properties are also found in cognate objects and weak definites in English, these two types of nominals are also event kind-classifying elements.

It is first illustrated that null clausal arguments have underlying syntactic structures that are subject to ellipsis. The main and novel observation for this claim is that null clausal arguments exhibit the effect of the parallelism constraint that other ellipsis constructions like verb phrase ellipsis are also subject to, along the line with Takahashi (2013, “A Note on Parallelism for Elliptic Arguments,” Proceedings of Formal Approaches to Japanese Linguistics 6, MITWPL). It then examines a hitherto unexplored construction, called antecedent-contained clausal argument ellipsis, where a null clausal argument appears to be properly contained by its antecedent. Although the construction can be readily accommodated by assuming the ellipsis process that directly elides arguments (argument ellipsis), it raises serious difficulties for its alternative analysis that employs the ellipsis process targeting a VP whose head has evacuated it (verb-stranding VP-ellipsis). This paper thus provides a novel case where the argument ellipsis analysis is required, no matter how well the verb-stranding VP-ellipsis analysis accommodates other null argument phenomena.',\n",

If the A-/A’-distinction is to be truly derived, then the characteristic that distinguishes the two classes of structures must emerge from a conspiracy of independently motivated principles and the distinction should explain why the contrasts between A-/A’-constructions are precisely those contrasts and not other contrasts. The key theoretical proposal that underlies my account is that an independently motivated alteration in the terms available to Merge results in a crucial difference between the two construction types. Once a wh-phrase DP moves, a conspiracy of factors insures that it is altered on the way to its landing site or else it will interfere with normal Case and agreement relations (as first proposed by Rezac, 2003). An optional instance of Merge, late attachment of a prepositional head to the moved DP, ‘insulates’ that DP from Case and agreement, but alters the relations it can have with other DPs, with wide consequences for what an insulated DP can antecede and or license. A revision of Chomsky’s (1995) ‘Extension’, the Peak Novelty Condition proposed here, is independently necessary to permit a variety of constructions, such as late attachment, tucking in, and head-adjunction, among others. Thus the possibility to Merge an insulator to a moved DP is just a consequence of what Merge operations are available. Although insulation is optional, it is limited by independently motivated interface requirements that determine the distribution of insulated constituents, thereby explaining what is crucially different about A- vs. A’-constructions and why A- and A’-structures differ in just the ways they do and not in other ways.',\n",

In Tlingit, certain negative gradable predicates are formed by negating a positive root and then applying an additional (unproductive) morphological operation: e.g. k’éi ‘good’, tlél ukʼé ‘not good’, tlél ushké ‘bad’. A variety of facts show that (i) the negation in forms like tlél ushké ‘bad’ is VP-external, clausal negation, and is not an incorporated negative prefix like un- in English, and (ii) the meaning of these forms is indeed that of a gradable negative predicate, and is not simply the propositional negation of the positive predicate (unlike tlél ukʼé ‘not good’). Under the proposed analysis, the additional morphological operation observed in these forms is the reflex of a special degree relativizer, one that is not found in English and must undergo movement to Spec-NegP. In addition, Tlingit differs from English and other languages in that degree operators – like POS and comparative operators – can be adjoined relatively high in the clause, above negation. In addition to capturing a variety of facts concerning these negative predicates, the proposed analysis has consequences for our understanding of more general issues surrounding gradable predicates, particularly so-called ‘Cross-Polar Nomalies’ (CPNs) (Büring 2007a,b; Heim 2008) and intervention effects in the movement of degree operators (Heim 2001). Regarding the former, I show that Tlingit exhibits CPNs directly parallel to those in English. However, due to idiosyncrasies of Tlingit morphosyntax, Büring’s (2007a,b) analysis of these phenomena has an advantage over Heim’s (2008) account.',\n",

Potential neurobiological correlates supporting various parts of CP are presented.

In this study, I evaluate this claim in light of Tuscan Italian. Using three phonological diagnostics, it will be possible to split the consonant clusters (CCs) of Tuscan into three types: Branching onset, Coda-Onset and Bogus clusters. Metrical lengthening and Gorgia Toscana filter out Branching onsets leaving behind Coda-Onset and Bogus clusters as remnant. Elsewhere, the process of Epenthesis (in non-standard dialects) filters out the Bogus clusters instead leaving Branching onsets and Coda-Onset clusters as remnant. Comparing the two sets of remnant allows for the extraction of the Coda-Onset set. Using a Sonority Differential analysis (Parker 2011), it becomes evident (process by process) that sonority is not the primary (or a preferable) mechanism in determining these sets. In seeking an alternative analysis, Gorgia Toscana will be presented in some detail along with its implications for sonority. Gorgia underapplies with Bogus clusters. I will provide a suggestive sketch for a competing representational solution based on Strict CV (in particular Lowenstamm 2003 and Brun-Trigud & Scheer 2010).

I dub these two forms COPY NPIs because they involve reduplication. There is a discussion on whether the COPY NPIs are Type1 or Type2 NPIs in line with Collins and Postal’s (2014) distinction between the two types of NPI, which corresponds to the traditional Strict and Non-strict distinction. The Yorùbá COPY NPI data are described using the framework developed in Collins and Postal (2014), where NPIs are analyzed in terms of NPI-internal Neg formation, matrix clause Neg-raising, and Neg deletion. I argue that this way of looking at NPIs provides an insight into the internal properties of NPIs cross-linguistically and an avenue to further examine the properties of sentential negative markers by looking at how negation is formed within NPIs. Building on the proposed parameters in Collins et al. (2015), four parameters are set for Yorùbá COPY NPIs against English any-NPIs and Ewe Ke-NPIs.',\n",

It is in this sense that label is not only “conceptually necessary” but also empirically necessary for objects generated by narrow syntax, which have to be interpreted at the interfaces that relate language to the rest of the cognitive faculties.

In the traditional naming pattern, Korean first names consist of a generation marker and a unique portion, and the order between these two elements alternates between generations. To derive vocative forms, the generation marker is truncated, and the suffixal [(j)a] is attached to the unique portion. We argue that MOP naturally predicts this type of truncation. As the generation marker is shared by all the members of the same generation, the generation marker is highly predictable and hence does not reduce uncertainty about the intended message. To achieve effective communication, predictable portions are deleted. To the extent that our analysis is on the right track, it implies that MOP is relevant not only to phonetic implementation patterns, but also to (morpho-)phonological patterns. It also provides support to MOP based on data from a non-Indo-European language. Finally, we aim to integrate insights of MOP with a more formal proposal like Optimality Theory, by relating the predictability of a contrast to the ranking of the faithfulness constraint that it protects, following the spirit of the P-map hypothesis.',\n",

       "  'This thesis is a study of the syntax of multi-verb constructions, in which a single clause contains more than one verbal element. Multi-verb constructions are of special interest in light of the hypothesis that clausal structure is headed by a verb. Implemented in terms of extended projections, this hypothesis states that clausal functional structure is the extended projection of a verb. A full understanding of multi-verbal constructions, in which there is no one-to-one verb–clause mapping, relies on refinements of the intimate relation between clause structure and the verbal category. Analyzing various types of multi-verb constructions in Ndebele, a Bantu language of Zimbabwe, I propose a theory multi-verbal syntax which makes explicit the ways in which a single extended projection may contain more than one verb. I propose a basic distinction within the verbal category into projecting verbs and non-projecting verbs. Projecting verbs have the ability to head a full clause and are what we typically think of as lexical verbs. Non-projecting verbs, on the other hand, are inherently unable to project full clausal structure. There are two types of non-projecting verbs in Ndebele. Aspectual auxiliaries are lexical items whose category feature has mixed properties: it has properties of both a lexical verb and some functional head in the clausal spine. The mixed properties are detected by different aspects of their syntax. The second type of non-projecting verb is the default auxiliary (be, in Ndebele), used in compound tenses. The default auxiliary is a verbal expletive, which becomes part of the derivation via last-resort selection. Any multi-verbal construction with more than one lexical (projecting) verb necessarily contains more than one extended projection. Additionally, the thesis is concerned with the role of two syntactic dependencies in the inflectional domain: agreement and selection. Both relations are involved in determining the morphological shape of multi-verb constructions by posing restrictions on the form, category and size of the main lexical verb. Depending on the light/auxiliary verb, it can be a participle (imperfective, past or future), have a subjunctive form (present or past), or be infinitival/clausal. It is argued that such cooccurrence patterns are largely predictable from clause structure and agreement. Selection is involved only in a small set of idiosyncratic cases of complement selection.',\n",

Especially in the latter case, it is tempting to analyze such cases as instances of sluicing, on a par with interrogative/question examples like \"He\\'s talented, but I don\\'t know how talented\".

Reduced unconditionals in English therefore appear to be genuine cases of pseudosluicing (Merchant 1998).

This article provides new arguments for Herbert’s position, drawn from a large typological study of South American languages.

For Hebrew, we demonstrate that a passive gap is not the result of competition with analytic paraphrases. For Latin, we show that a cyclic, syntax-based approach is superior to a theory that generates nonactive verbs in the lexicon and has them compete against each other.

I will present a set of paradoxical cases in which resumption in Kaqchikel displays no movement properties in a simple clause, whereas it does in a long-distance dependency. I will suggest that the domain of locality relevant to resumptive dependencies in Kaqchikel is more constrained than in other widely discussed resumptive languages like Irish and Hebrew. Specifically, it will be proposed that a resumptive pronoun in Kaqchikel must be licensed within a clause: the Clause-Mate Condition on Resumptive Chains (CCRC).

We concentrate in particular on antecedents that contain two quantified statements and uncover a surprising asymmetry, where surface-scope antecedents can license a multiple sluice, but inverse-scope antecedents cannot. We argue that this finding is explained by semantic accounts of ellipsis licensing, where ellipsis is licensed when the sluice corresponds to an (implicit) Question under Discussion (cf.

We show that QuDs cannot be computed based on the truth-conditional content of the antecedents alone; instead, they must be computed only after (scalar) implicatures have been calculated and added to the common ground, along with the context of utterance.

       "  'As is well known, the control dependency in grammar is broadly distinguished into two broad classes: exhaustive (i → i) and non-exhaustive (i → i+(j)). The goal of this paper is to show that languages seem to allow another type of control in addition to these and to provide a formal account for how it may be derived in grammar. This new type of control is neither exhaustive nor strictly non-exhaustive, in the sense described above. Rather, it involves a mapping between an individual i and another individual f(i), where f is a discourse-contextually defined function denoting some sort of social group or class membership, and where i is not = f(i). We call this new type of control \"proxy control\", in analogy with instances of proxy anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Schladt 2000, Reuland and Winter 2009) which have also been argued to involve a relation of this nature. Proxy control is interesting not only because it extends the typology of possible control relations in grammar, but also because it raises interesting questions about the distribution of OC vs. NOC and the factors that condition the parametric choice between the two. Our primary data comes from German and Italian collected from native speakers in in-person grammaticality judgment tasks and online surveys. For speakers of the southern standard dialects of German (Bavarian-Swabian, Swabian, Bavarian, and Austrian) and the Grossetano dialect of Italian (spoken in parts of Tuscany), we present empirical diagnostics to show that proxy control instantiates a species of OC. For the rest of the native speakers of German and Italian tested, proxy control instantiates a choice of NOC. We focus primarily on proxy OC in this paper and propose that it involves a kind of “cyclic” control: the first cycle involves a i → f (i) control dependency into a bouletic modal complement; the second, an f(i) → f(i) exhaustive control dependency into a deontic modal clause. Proxy OC is the composite consisting of these put together. We present agreement evidence from floating quantifiers in Italian and Condition B obviation effects in German to argue that the i → f (i) relation is not established in syntax: rather, a simple i → i exhaustive control relation alone is syntactically encoded. This i on the controllee (PRO) is then semantically extended at LF to f(i) (following an adaption of the extension semantics for partial control in Pearson 2016) yielding i → f (i). Toward the end of the paper, we turn to a discussion of dialectal and crosslinguistic variation for proxy control, which revolves around whether proxy control is instantiated as a species of OC or NOC. We discuss the nature of the variation in detail and also propose the ways in which such variation could be theoretically understood and modelled within the analytic framework of our approach to proxy OC.',\n",

One direct consequence is that if both A- and A′-features trigger a movement operation in unison, it should show mixed A/A′-behavior. This prediction is borne out in Dinka, where C hosts both φ- and A′-features and triggers movement with both A- and A′-properties.\\r\\nIn this article, I extend this result to English. First, I show that the distribution of φ and A′ features in English is such that v, but not English C, is a potential composite movement trigger. This limited possibility for composite movement, I then argue, suggests a novel solution to the longstanding puzzle of English tough-movement (TM). TM famously shows mixed A/A′-behavior that has long posed a challenge in the context of the traditional A/A′-dichotomy – it is long-distance and can cross over c-commanding DPs, yet it targets a case position and triggers φ-Agreement – and moreover behaves as if Spec(CP) is an inaccessible landing site – it is fully acceptable across control infinitives, which lack a phasal CP (Wurmbrand 2014), but degraded past finite CPs, which do not. Treating TM as a successive cyclic composite movement operation from Spec(vP)-to-Spec(vP) solves these and several other novel and well-known puzzles of TM.',\n",

Apparent counterexamples, where conjuncts seem to differ with respect to morphological case marking, are claimed to be either due to a misanalysis of the underlying syntactic structure or due to superficial morphological processes that create the impression of a difference in case marking. Once we control for phenomena of this sort (namely &P-clitics, Suspended Affixation and Allomorphy), we find that case marking is always symmetric in nominal conjunction. This finding is in stark contrast to the phenomenon of phi-agreement which is known to exhibit asymmetry effects. Based on this observation, I show that the standard approach to case assignment according to which case arises only as a reflex of phi-agreement cannot account for this mismatch without stipulative assumptions. Under two more recent approaches to case marking, however, namely the Upward Agree approach as well as the Dependent Case Approach, the observed mismatch between case and agreement falls out as expected. Finally, I show that the generalization established in this paper can be used as a simple diagnostic to distinguish syntactic from morphological case marking alternations.\\r\\n',\n",

The regular comparative affix then spells out an additional feature relating to the comparative domain. In other words, we show that the comparative (CMPR) head that enters into the morphological makeup of the comparative (Bobaljik 2012) is to be split up into two distinct heads, C1 and C2 (see also Caha 2016). We extend this idea to SPRL, which we show is likewise to be split up into S1 and S2, in order to account for suppletive ABC patterns. These four distinct heads receive empirical support from facts of the degree morphology in Czech and Latin. The new account of root suppletion allows a straightforward way of deriving the attested and unattested patterns of (root) suppletion in degree comparison.

This paper makes two arguments: that a diverse range of phenomena exemplify irreducible parallelism; and that they have the same general structure. Our evidence comes primarily from the distribution of stress, lengthening, and epenthesis in Mohawk, and a reduplication-repair interaction in Maragoli. Our cases can be treated in OT, but challenge HS due to its gradualness requirement. These systems take on the following structure: to best satisfy constraints, the grammar applies one change followed by another, unless the result is ill-formed; in such a case, the grammar applies a different series of changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Soon to be superseded by a longer manuscript, which covers a broader range of cases and explores in greater depth their general structure.)',\n",

Concern over the less restricted nature of the new approach led some researchers to propose alternative analyses of these phenomena that did not require the unbounded reach of AGREE, in the hope that a more restrictive theory might yet be salvaged. In this paper I scrutinize some of the most widely cited and fully developed of these alternative proposals, applied to extensively studied spheres of data, and conclude that they are deeply, perhaps fatally, flawed.

       "  'This dissertation discusses the distribution of object pronouns, subject and object resumptive elements, and clausal determiners in Kwa (Niger-Congo) languages, particularly Gã and Akan. The empirical issues addressed are as follows. First,  some object pronouns are always overtly realised while others are always null. The aim was to provide a unified analysis of their distribution.  Second,  while Akan has been argued to have resumption for both subjects and objects in various A-bar constructions, only A-bar extracted object arguments yield an independent resumptive pronoun; a subject resumptive element is a bound form. Furthermore,  extracted local subject arguments always permit a default subject prefix in the extraction site. The aim was to provide a re-analysis of the empirical facts, to the effect that the subject case cannot be considered as a resumptive pronoun.  Third, it has been long observed that in Gã and several other Kwa languages, a determiner-like element shows up in complement clauses (CPs) from which A-bar extraction has taken place. It turns out that morphologically-similar functional elements are found in relative clauses and subject CPs, as well as adverbial clauses like conditional and time clauses when they occur to the left of a matrix clause. The aim was to account for the uniform behaviour of constructions which have this determiner-like element.\\r\\n In chapter  2, I argue that object pronouns that are always overtly realised, as in (a) those that precede an adverbial in (what looks like a) clause-final position, (b) when they occur as the object argument of a change of state predicate, (c) when they occur as the only argument of a depictive (secondary) predicate, and (d) when they are animate, are pronounced in a specifier position in the structure. For object pronouns that are null on the surface, however,  the proposed analysis suggests that their phonological contents are deleted in a complement position in the VP. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the predictions of the analysis are borne out in several other languages.\\r\\n I argue in chapter 3 that contrary to claims by previous authors,  Akan has no subject resumptive pronouns, and that what have been hitherto analysed as such can easily be accounted for as realisations of phi agreement on the  T(ense) head, which is realised on the verb. This is argued to result from a configuration in which a phi element stranded by an A-bar-marked element moves to spec, TP. This is the mechanism that is responsible for the cases of full phi agreement described above. On the other hand, when the A-bar-marked element moves to spec, TP, this results in lack of agreement, necessitating the insertion of a default marker.   The difference between local and embedded subject extraction is argued to be as a result of the lack of an A-bar projection in the embedded context, presumably to avoid the A-bar element from freezing clause-medially. I also demonstrate that the formal mechanism that derives the agreement affects in resumption constructions is also able to account for what looks like default agreement in non-A-bar constructions, a phenomenon whose data has largely gone unnoticed in previous work.\\r\\n Regarding clausal determiners, the analysis proposed in chapter 4 suggests that the  Gã data provide overt evidence for the claim in the literature that all CPs are dominated by a nominal projection. In this respect, the clausal determiner heads the nominal projection. Therefore, the analysis concludes that when a  CP occurs without a clausal determiner, it must have been deleted in the course of the derivation. Thus, a chunk of the chapter is devoted to showing how all the contexts in which the clausal determiner escapes the deletion mechanism converge, based on syntactic structure. ',\n",

       "  \"In many languages, φ-agreement with a DP is disrupted when that DP is involved in an A'dependency (e.g. wh-movement, relativization). Since Ouhalla 1993, this phenomenon has been known as anti-agreement. In this paper, we investigate cases of anti-agreement in which an A'extracted argument triggers anti-agreement not only on its locally φ-agreeing head, but also on a lower head that φ-agrees with a pronoun bound by the extracted argument (bound anti-agreement). Bound anti-agreement has received little attention in previous literature. Crucially, since the bound variable does not itself undergo movement, bound anti-agreement presents a challenge for analyses of anti-agreement that derive the effect through constraints on A'-movement. We argue instead that bound anti-agreement lends strong support to Baier's (2016) featural theory of anti-agreement, in which anti-agreement is the result of a φ-probe agreeing with an A’-operator bearing the feature [wh]. We moreover analyze bound anti-agreement in a parallel fashion to fake indexicals, thus unifying these two seemingly separate phenomena. Bound anti-agreement supports an analysis of fake indexicals in which a variable is 'born' underspecified, but acquires its features from its antecedent in the course of the derivation (e.g. Kratzer 2009). The features of the variable may be realized on the variable itself (as with fake indexicals) or as agreement with the variable (as seen in cases of bound anti-agreement).\",\n",

It argues that the derivation is driven by so-called derivational features, that is, structure-building features (Merge) and probe features (Agree) (Heck and Müller 2007 and Müller 2010; see also Chomsky 2000, 2001). Both types are essential in deriving case and agreement in the clausal domain and DP-internally. Feature values assigned by Merge take effect immediately whereas feature values assigned via Agree take effect at Spell-Out. This has the effect that Merge can overwrite Agree relations. \\r\\n\\r\\nI argue for a clear boundary between the syntactic and the morphological component regarding how case is assigned and agreement derived, placing Agree, Merge and case assignment in syntax whereas a translation of case assignment into morphological case and agreement takes place in the morphological component. Case morphology is the result of a three-step process: (i) A syntactic relationship with a functional head (e.g., Agree with Voice); (ii) a morphological translation of that relationship into a case feature (e.g., from syntactic STR to morphological ACC); and (iii) a morphological realization of that feature at Vocabulary Insertion. I argue that there are three types of syntactic case: structural, inherent and quirky case. Structural nominative case is either the result of structural case assignment or the realization of unassigned case. If a DP has not been assigned case by Spell-Out, its syntactic case is determined as STR. Structural and quirky case is often assigned by Voice via Agree but inherent case is assigned by Appl via Merge. \\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the dissertation studies the interaction of Voice, case and implicit arguments. It provides new analyses for various constructions in Icelandic where the dichotomy between active and passive breaks down. As I demonstrate, passive and active are labels for a collection of properties of VoiceP, where these properties may vary partially independently, yielding constructions that do not fit the traditional labels. I refine and improve our understanding of the nature of implicit arguments and how they interact with different Voice types. Following Landau’s (2010) distinction between Weak and Strong Implicit Arguments (WIA and SIA), I extend Legate’s (2014) analysis of the New Impersonal Construction to other constructions. I propose that WIAs are not always projected but when they are, they bear case. Furthermore, I propose that weak implicit arguments have an overtly realized counterpart, which I call Weak Explicit Arguments.',\n",

       "  'The standard grammatical theory of scalar implicature, as envisioned by Chierchia (2004), Fox (2007), and Chierchia, Fox, and Spector (2012), posits that scalar implicatures are derived in grammar, as a matter semantics, rather than pragmatically, as an implicature rooted in Grice\\'s maxim of quantity. Ignorance inferences, by contrast, e.g. those associated with plain disjunctive sentences, are derived pragmatically, as quantity implicatures. More generally, the standard theory predicts that for any utterance S and any relevant proposition φ which isn\\'t entailed, and whose negation isn\\'t entailed, by S, S gives rise to an inference of speaker ignorance about φ. We argue that this prediction is wrong: it fails to explain the contrast in ignorance inferences associated with \"at least\" (which obligatorily implies ignorance) vs. \"more than\" (which doesn\\'t) (Geurts and Nouwen 2007; Nouwen 2010, 2015). The problem is that, without stipulating restrictions on which propositions are relevant, the theory overgenerates ignorance inferences across the board. We argue that the solution is to close relevance under belief (if φ is relevant, then it\\'s also relevant whether the speaker believes φ). This move has the effect that ignorance inferences, like scalar implicatures, can only be derived in grammar, via a covert belief operator of the sort proposed by Meyer (2013) and discussed further by Fox (2016). The maxim of quantity, we show, then no longer enriches the meaning of an utterance, per se, but rather acts as a filter on what can be relevant in an utterance context. In particular, certain alternatives (of certain utterances) are shown to be incapable of being relevant in any context where the maxim of quantity is active -- a property we dub obligatory irrelevance. We argue that obligatory irrelevance provides the key to understanding the contrast in ignorance inferences exhibited by \"at least\" vs. \"more than\". We also argue that translating our proposal into neo-Gricean terms, if at all possible, would yield a conceptually less appealing and empirically less adequate theory.',\n",

       "  '\\r\\nPhonological variation is common in many alternations, especially in processes where the target and the trigger of the alternation are in different words—external sandhi processes. Much previous work on external sandhi has addressed the morpho-syntactic locality conditions that restrict these cross-word processes, but they are also often sensitive to phonetic and usage factors like pauses, speech rate, lexical frequency, and speech style. What has not been explored in previous work is why these factors are consistently associated with external sandhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thesis pursues the hypothesis that patterns of external sandhi variation are shaped by online speech production planning constraints, which can mediate the effect of both grammatical and non-grammatical factors. I investigate the Production Planning Hypothesis (PPH) proposal that the narrow window of phonological encoding can block application of external sandhi processes—if the triggering context is not within the same planning window as the target of a process, it cannot apply. The size of the speech planning window is variable, and has been shown to be influenced by many of the factors associated with phonological variation. The predictions of the PPH are tested in case studies of three different external sandhi processes. These studies also contribute to a general understanding of the relationship between variability and syntactic, prosodic, and lexical factors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first study investigates the effect of word boundaries, prosodic position, and phonetic pauses on variation of high vowel devoicing (HVD) in Tokyo Japanese. Statistical modeling of HVD patterns in a corpus of spontaneous speech suggests that these factors jointly affect HVD, and that position within a prosodic phrase modulates the effect of speech rate and lexical frequency on HVD. It is proposed that two distinct processes underlie HVD, one that is sensitive to the segmental content of the upcoming word (interconsonantal HVD), and another that is triggered by strong prosodic boundaries (phrase-final HVD). Under this view, part of the variation can be explained under the PPH as production planning effects on interconsonantal HVD.\\r\\nIn a second case study, two factors previously associated with external sandhi variation are tested directly: syntactic structure, and lexical frequency. Both of these factors have also been shown to affect speech planning and therefore, according to the PPH, should affect external sandhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a production experiment, we examine the effect of a clause boundary on realization of word-final coronal stops in North American English. Clause boundaries are found to have a gradient inhibitory effect on flapping, beyond the effect of associated final lengthening. The PPH explanation for this effect is that a clause boundary induces a delay while high-level planning of the next clause takes place, so segmental details of a potentially flap-triggering word will rarely be available. In contrast, a word that is within the same clause is much more like to be planned within the same window.\\r\\n\\r\\nLexical frequency can also affect the time course of speech planning. Higher lexical frequency is associated with faster retrieval, so the PPH predicts that the realization of a word-final coronal stop will be related to the frequency of the word that follows it. A higher frequency following word will be retrieved more quickly, and be more likely to trigger flapping. The relationship between lexical frequency and coronal stop realization is examined in a corpus of American English, and a positive correlation is found between frequency and flapping, as predicted.\\r\\nThe third case study extends testing of PPH predictions to a non-reductive external sandhi process: liaison in French. Frequency and also predictability are used as proxies for upcoming word availability. The PPH predicts that the correlations should be positive, just as for flapping, since both flapping and liaison rely on the knowledge that the upcoming word starts with a vowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamination of two syntactic contexts suggests that increased following word predictability, measured by both local (conditional probability) and global (lexical frequency), increase the likelihood of liaison application. Finding the same effect for the qualitatively distinct processes of flapping and liaison lends support to the PPH proposal that accessibility of the word containing the triggering information for sandhi constrains application of the process.\\r\\nThe PPH offers a unified account of variation in external sandhi related to both grammatical and non-grammatical factors. In addition, the PPH makes many new, testable predictions for future work: the size of the window for phonological encoding should be correlated with the application of external sandhi, with less sandhi applying when the window is more narrow.',\n",

It is argued that the SV/VS order in Spanish follows from the conditions of valuation of [DI] in each case; in particular, valuation of [DI] in d-sentences will be a matter of structural and semantic prominence whereas in context-dependent sentences it will depend on pragmatic conditions.

       "  'Findings from the field of experimental linguistics have shown that a native speaker may judge a variant that is part of her grammar as unacceptable, but still use it productively in spontaneous speech. The process of eliciting acceptability judgments from speakers of non-standard languages is sometimes clouded by factors akin to prescriptive notions of grammatical correctness. It has been argued that standardization enhances the ability to make clear-cut judgments, while non-standardization may result to grammatical hybridity, often manifested in the form of functionally equivalent variants in the repertoire of a single speaker. Recognizing the importance of working with corpora of spontaneous speech, this work investigates patterns of variation in the spontaneous production of five neurotypical, adult speakers of a non-standard variety in terms of three variants, each targeting one level of linguistic analysis: syntax, morphology, and phonology. The results reveal the existence of functionally equivalent variants across speakers and levels of analysis. We first discuss these findings in relation to the notions of competing, mixed, and fused grammars, and then we flesh out the implications that different values of the same variant carry for parametric approaches to Universal Grammar. We observe that intraspeaker realizations of different values of the same variant within the same syntactic environment are incompatible with the ‘triggering-a-single-value’ approach of parametric models, but we argue that they are compatible with the concept of Universal Grammar itself. Since the analysis of these variants is ultimately a way of investigating the status of Universal Grammar primitives, we conclude that claims about the alleged unfalsifiability of (the contents of) Universal Grammar are unfounded.',\n",

       "  'This thesis is a cross-linguistic investigation into the nature of null arguments in radical pro-drop languages where null arguments are claimed to be derivable via the process called argument ellipsis, which directly elides arguments. I examine whether null arguments in such languages involve internal structure by testing extraction possibilities out of them on the basis of the hypothesis that the possibility of extraction indicates the presence of internal structure in anaphora sites. Based on novel data from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, and Turkish, I show that elliptic arguments exhibit a hitherto unnoticed pattern of extraction out of ellipsis sites, a pattern that does not follow from either Hankamer and Sag’s (1976) surface anaphora such as VP-ellipsis or deep anaphora such as do it anaphora. Specifically, I show that null arguments in the languages in question uniformly disallow overt extraction out of them, while they uniformly allow covert extraction (more precisely, extraction that does not affect word order). Having established the overt/covert extraction asymmetry out of null arguments under consideration, I show that the extraction pattern in question has several consequences for the PF-deletion versus LF-copying debate in the literature on ellipsis. Specifically, taking the possibility of overt extraction out of anaphora sites as an indication of the presence of internal structure in overt syntax and the possibility of covert extraction as an indication of the presence of internal structure in covert syntax/LF, I argue that the relevant extraction asymmetry out of null arguments in question is best analyzed under the LF-copy analysis, which provides ellipsis domains with internal structure only in covert syntax/LF so that only covert movement is possible out of the relevant domains. I argue that PF-deletion is also an available strategy and propose that the dichotomy between PF-deletion and LF-copying is related to the phasal status of ellipsis domains, building on Bošković’s (2014) phase-based analysis of ellipsis, where only phases and phasal complements can undergo ellipsis. In particular, I claim that ellipsis of phases, including argument ellipsis, is implemented by LF-copying and ellipsis of phasal complements is implemented by PF-deletion, which is shown to be a by-product of the phase theory. Finally, I show that the LF-copy analysis of elliptic arguments has consequences for the proper analysis of a number of phenomena, including wh-in-situ, control, and the timing of null operator movement.\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'Whenever two otherwise similar grammatical elements display distinct properties and appear in distinct environments, we have in principle two analytic possibilities. One is to posit that they are indeed two underlying elements with inherently distinct properties, which then lead to them having different distributions (Inherent view). The other is to posit a single underlying element with a broad distribution, with the grammatical distinctions arising from the different contexts in which that element appears (Derived view). The goal of this paper is to provide novel theoretical and empirical evidence supporting a version of the Derived view for pro vs. PRO. In particular, we will argue that OC PRO and pro are just labels for different manifestations of what is underlyingly a single underspecified nominal pro-form, which we will call UPro. Included under this UPro will also be the various types of ‘non-obligatory control’ (NOC) PRO, including arbitrary pro (pro_arb). The interpretive and distributional distinctions lurking behind these labels will be seen to derive from how UPro interacts with its structural environment and language-specific rules of morpho-phonological realization. Specifically, OC PRO labels a rather specific interpretation that arises in embedding contexts where a syntactic OC relationship with an antecedent can be established. Different types of pro and NOC PRO, on the other hand, involve ‘control’ by (typically) silent representations of discourse-contextual elements in the clausal left periphery. Finally, pro_arb arguably involves the failure to establish a referential dependence, which we will formalize in terms of a failure to Agree in the sense of Preminger (2014). The crucial evidence that motivates the Derived approach proposed here will be adduced from the “Finiteness pro-drop Generalisation” from Sundaresan (2014): \"For (at least a non-trivial set of) pro-drop languages with subject-verb agreement, pro-drop is disallowed in the subject position of a prototypically non-finite clause.\"',\n",

One class of parentheticals that has received much recent attention with regards to this issue is appositive relative clauses (ARCs).\\r\\n\\tIn support of a more general integrational view, Griffiths & De Vries (2013, henceforth G&dV) offer an additional specific argument in favour of treating ARCs as syntactically integrated into their hosts. This argument revolves arounds the distribution of ARCs in clausal ellipsis environments. In a recent reply to G&dV, Ott (2016) counters this specific argument, discards the more general integration analysis adopted by G&dV on conceptual grounds, and contends that an orphanage analysis of ARCs provides a more parsimonious explanation for the data that G&dV introduce.\\r\\n\\tIn this more elaborate rejoinder to Ott’s (2016) reply, we demonstrate that, while Ott presents some relevant data and provides welcome discussion, his specific counterargument to G&dV does not withstand scrutiny. More importantly, we also defend the integration approach to ARCs (and to parenthesis more generally) on conceptual and empirical grounds. In particular we wish to stress that, if one given implementation of the integration analysis exhibits shortcomings, this does not logically imply that parentheticals must be orphans. Indeed, we will demonstrate that recent research on the ‘syntacticisation’ of speech acts engenders an integration analysis that does not exhibit the conceptual deficiency that Ott attributes to G&dV’s analysis. Lastly, we examine the orphanage analysis of ARCs and argue that such an approach has conceptual and empirical inadequacies that no integration approach exhibits.\\r\\n',\n",

One of them is the alternation between verbal agreement paradigms common in Algonquian languages: SIMPLE vs. COMPLEX agreement (traditionally Conjunct Order and Independent Order), and the other is the distribution of Verb Second (V2) in Germanic. The basic Algonquian pattern uses COMPLEX agreement (characterized by an agreement proclitic) as the default, with SIMPLE agreement (that lacks the proclitic) being restricted to a small “marked” set of clauses. We focus primarily on Arapaho (Plains Algonquian) as an outlier within its language family – it uses SIMPLE agreement as the default and COMPLEX agreement as the “marked” paradigm, comparing it to English and its “Residual V2” pattern of Aux-C inversion. We argue that the similarities between the two “residual” patterns are not coincidental and reveal a deeper parallelism: the distribution of V2 in Germanic and the SIMPLE/COMPLEX alternation in Algonquian stem from the same requirement of the verb to move to C only in some syntactic environments. The main difference is that in Algonquian V-C movement feeds the realization of additional C-related agreement. This allows us to extend Richards’s (2004) analysis of the agreement alternation in Wampanoag (Eastern Algonquian) to both the “basic Algonquian” and Arapaho patterns by treating the former as the Algonquian equivalent of “canonical V2” and the later as “Residual V2”.',\n",

In Theme passives, the Theme moves initially to the edge of ApplP, and subsequently to specTP. This blocks A-bar movement of the Recipient, which gets transferred along with the lower phase. In the Recipient passive, the Recipient moves to specTP before transfer of the lower phase, and the Theme argument remains accessible as it occupies the outer specifier of ApplP.

We argue that estar signals that the prejacent is boundedly true at the evaluation circumstance. The prejacent’s bounded truth at a circumstance i at a given context of use c depends on the existence of no-weaker alternative circumstances i′ accessible at c where the prejacent is false and on i being a maximal verifying circumstance at c. The analysis relies crucially on an explication of a strength ordering over alternative circumstances of evaluation. The assumption of this presuppositional component accounts for the distinct flavors of interpretation associated with estar with a range of predicates. ser is shown to be associated with its own inferences that derive from its status as the presuppositionally weaker, neutral member of the pair.',\n",

This explains the O>S word order but also the fact that straightforward extraction of all vP-internal material is banned. In the case of predominantly VSO languages, however, we propose that syntactic ergativity affects only the transitive subject: extraction of vP-internal adjuncts is unrestricted. This is because in S>O languages, the extraction restriction results from anti-locality, of the kind proposed by Erlewine (2016). We argue, moreover, that both kinds of syntactic ergativity in these languages ultimately arise due to defective intervention of the ergative subject in the Agree relation between INFL and the internal argument. There are essentially two ways to circumvent this problem: either S 'sidesteps' to spec INFL, or O leapfrogs to the outer spec vP.\",\n",

First, Role Shift used to report attitudes ('Attitude Role Shift') has a quotational component which does not follow from a simple context-shifting analysis. Second, Role Shift used to report other actions ('Action Role Shift') has a strong iconic component:  properties of signs that can be assigned to the reported situation (e.g. a happy face) must be so interpreted. We argue that both varieties of Role Shift should be analyzed as context shift, but with an important addition: the expressions that appear under Role Shift should be interpreted maximally iconically, i.e. so as to maximize the possibilities of projection between the signs used and the situation they make reference to (Role Shift is thus a 'super monster' not just in that it can shift the context outside of attitude reports, as was argued in Part I, but also in that it has an iconic and thus hyperintensional component).  This accounts both for the quotational character of Attitude Role Shift (in this case, maximal iconicity reduces to quotation), and for the fact that Action Role Shift has a strong iconic component. Finally, this analysis vindicates the view that some expressions may be simultaneously used and mentioned/demonstrated, as argued for instance in Recanati 2001.\",\n",

       "  \"We provide the outline of a semantics for music. We take music cognition to be continuous with normal auditory cognition, and thus to deliver inferences about 'virtual sources' of the music (as in Bregman's Auditory Scene Analysis). As a result, sound parameters that trigger inferences about sound sources in normal auditory cognition produce related ones in music – as is the case when decreasing loudness signals the end of a piece because the source is gradually losing energy, or moving away. But what is special about music is that it also triggers inferences on the basis of the movement of virtual sources in tonal pitch space, which has points of stability (e.g., a tonic chord), points of instability (e.g., dissonant chords), and relations of attractions among them (e.g., a dissonant chord tends to be resolved). In this way, gradual movement towards a point of tonal stability, as in a cadence, may also serve to signal the end of a piece, but on the basis of tonal information. The challenge is thus to develop a framework that aggregates inferences from normal auditory cognition and tonal inferences. We sketch such a framework in a highly simplified case, by arguing that a source undergoing a musical movement m is true of an object undergoing a series of events e just in case there is a certain structure-preserving map between m and e. Thus we require that inferences triggered by loudness on the relative levels of energy or proximity among events should be preserved, and similarly for tonal inferences pertaining to the relative stability of events. This yields a 'bare bones' version of a music semantics, as well as a definition of 'musical truth'.  We then argue that this framework can help re-visit some aspects of musical syntax. Specifically, we take (Lerdahl & Jackendoff's, 1983) grouping structure to reflect the mereology ('partology') of events that are abstractly represented in the music – hence the importance of Gestalt principles of perception in defining musical groups.  Finally, we argue that this 'referentialist' approach to music semantics still has the potential to provide an account of diverse emotional effects in music.\",\n",

Numerals, for instance, very often show some nominal or adjectival properties (lexical), despite having a quantificational function (functional). Such semi-lexical elements challenge theories of categories which assume discrete distinctions between nouns, verbs, and adjectives. If a numeral shares some, but not all properties with a noun, should we call it a noun instead of a numeral? This dissertation addresses such questions, and explores the concept of semi-lexicality. It focuses on phenomena in the nominal domain which largely involve idiosyncratic patterns of case and agreement. This thesis aims to identify how semi-lexicality arises in the syntax and what consequences it has for conceptualizations of categories. Semi-lexicality is explored via three case studies: Polish numerals, English quantificational nouns (lot, ton, bunch, number), and English kind-words (kind, type, sort). These case studies illustrate a variety of ways of being semi-lexical, and motivate an approach to semi-lexicality which decomposes basic notions of categories. By developing a precise theory of what it means to be lexical, functional, and semi-lexical, this thesis shows that it is possible to capture the idiosyncrasies of semi-lexicality in a predictable way.\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'Slovenian features at least two lexical items that are potential semantic counterparts of the English \"many\", namely \"veliko\" and \"precej\", whose meaning appears close to identical Yet speakers are certain that the two items are not equivalent, although they find intuitively felt differences hard to pinpoint. We argue that \"precej\" and \"veliko\" are lexically synonymous, but their meanings are pragmatically strengthened under relevant conditions, which leads to subtle interpretative differences. Specifically, we extend Krifka’s (2007) analysis of double negatives and propose that \"veliko\" is assigned the stereotypical interpretation of a quantity degree word, whereas \"precej\" is identified with the non-stereotypical one and consequently relates to moderately big amounts. To support this claim, we report the results of an experiment involving a sentence-picture verification task, which highlight the similarities and contextually-determined differences in the use of both determiners. Our results suggest that the interpretation of \"precej\" is not consistent with relations in the upper part of the proportional scale and is dependent on whether or not it is in direct competition with \"veliko\" in the appropriate contexts.

Apparent instances of upward-probing feature-valuation are analyzed as anaphoric feature valuation, which is a com- posite operation consisting of movement of the relevant (unvalued, interpretable) features followed by probing of their c-command domain for valuation. A model of syntax that relies on the referential properties of phases is proposed to derive the behavior of anaphoric features from more fundamental syntactic properties, namely, that more rigid reference of a phase is derived by movement of phase-internal elements to the edge of that phase.',\n",

However it is in its infancy in classifier languages (ClLs), languages with a typically extensive inventory of ‘measure words’ that must be used in combining a numeral with any N. Building on Jiang and Hu 2010, I am going to document the existence of a classifier language with a lexical article, i.e. Yi, a Sino-Tibetan language, and provide a parametric analysis of such a language with respect to Mandarin. My main thesis is going to be roughly the following. There has been an ongoing debate on whether D is present in classifier languages and whether projecting D is always necessary for argument formation.

It is rather constructional, or built in syntax, distributing and receiving polysemous interpretations at various syntactic layers of the DP or CP, depending on quantity, perspective, evaluation, performativity, etc. Within this view, and apart from describing and identifying the various specifics of gender morphology, syntax, and semantics of some Arabic varieties, and investigating cross-linguistic parallels in other languages such as Romance, Berber, and Hebrew (see Fassi Fehri 2016 a &b), my broad empirical and theoretical interest in this article is to instantiate significant close interactions of the various grammatical categories found in the DP and Gender, and to account for how these interpenetrations follow naturally from appropriate hypotheses about articulation and design of grammatical architecture, framed in a form of what I will call functional universalism.

Our proposal successfully predicts the extant typology of prosodic identity effects in copy epenthesis; alternative analyses of copy epenthesis relying solely on featural spreading (e.g. Kawahara 2007) or gestural realignment (e.g. Hall 2003, 2006) do not naturally capture the effects discussed here.',\n",

For this purpose, the empirical basis of the paper is a stronghold of moraic theory: stress in Palestinian Arabic, with its rich interplay of syllable structure and stress assignment, involving quantity sensitivity, a syllabically-determined stress shift and metrically-conditioned long vowel shortening. Showcasing the innovative grid-based notion of weight incorporation in Ulfsbjorninn (2014), the account provided recognizes only one unit relevant for meter: the nucleus. No appeal is made to moras, syllables, feet or extrametricality. Besides these principled advantages over the traditional moraic account, it is shown that metrical vowel shortening is much more simply explained in the present framework than in the moraic account, and can also explain final vowel shortening. The analysis is also brought to bear on Cairene Arabic, which in our analysis differs from Palestinian in a single parameter setting.  Finally, the paper also improves on previous analyses of meter in Strict CV, as for the first time in Strict CV metrics, a computational component is explicitly formalized. Given all of the advantages of the Strict CV account here presented, we submit that this framework, rather than the moraic alternative, should be pursued.',\n",

Several diagnostics are provided in order to help to a better understanding of the relevant empirical domains. A set of such diagnostics comes from uniformity considerations; i.e., the parallelism between elliptical and non-elliptical nominal phrases with respect to thematic assignment, matching effects and extraction. Other set comes from the specific conditions that distinguish empty nouns from nominal ellipses with respect to the need of an antecedent, identity effects, productivity and lexical meaning. The chapter also presents a discussion on the recoverability and licensing conditions that regulate the distribution of nominal ellipses. On the one hand, I show why syntactic identity is unavoidable for nominal ellipses. On the other hand, I try to demonstrate that there is no licensing by inflection in nominal ellipses of any sort. Instead, the morphological effects we observe are epiphenomena resulting from the way in which morphology resolves different stranded affix scenarios. Finally, I explore the domain of null arguments in null subject/object languages. It is shown on the basis of robust empirical evidence that the same distinction between empty nouns and ellipsis applies in this domain. The conclusion is that different sorts of nominal ellipses within and across languages ultimately boil down to the deep and surface anaphora distinction, on the one hand, and to the size of the constituent affected in each case, on the other.',\n",

We will argue that there are three independent clause types, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive clause type, the differences between them derived from a morphologically founded distinction between three verbal paradigms, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive one. \\r\\n\\t\\tWe will further show how the three basic clause types are built up by three autonomous and interdependent modular systems, the morpho-syntactic, the semantic and the speech act system. Whereas the morpho-syntactic system operates with valued and unvalued features of various kinds, like [finite] and [φ], the semantic system supplies modal operators, that will provide the clause type with a clause type meaning. The speech act system will turn the clause type with its clause type meaning into a speech act, being the act the speaker performs, when uttering a clause. Not until the clause is accepted as a proper speech act at the speech act interface, will it become speech.\\r\\n\\tLike in Platzack & Rosengren (1998), we also once more claim, that the imperative clause type lacks TP, which in turn prevents it from getting a subject and embed. \\r\\n\\tBecause of its non-finite, i.e. imperative head, the imperative clause will be a clause type in the system of clause types right from the morphological beginning. It differs substantially in its syntactic structure from the finite clause as well as from the infinitive clause, being a clause type with a head with only a 2nd person inflection. This difference results in a slim structure, univocal meaning and a restricted area of application, the speaker uttering it in order to make or allow the addressee to act according to a norm. It can hence only be used to talk TO the addressee, not ABOUT him.\\r\\n',\n",

In the first two experiments, we show that children display a developmental discontinuity in their ability to use a noun's syntactic environment as a cue to its meaning. We argue that this pattern arises from children's reliance on their knowledge of verbs' subcategorization frame frequencies to guide parsing, coupled with an inability to revise incremental parsing decisions.

The minimally different options allowed by the grammars of the ItaloRomance varieties considered are syntactically driven by the same mechanisms at work in Standard Italian complex PPs, i. e., small Ps are selected according to: (i) the interrelated movement/merge of PLACE to the edge of DPPlace and of AxParts in PPdir/PPstat, and (ii) the pronominal vs. nominal nature of the Ground. The microcomparative perspective adopted sheds some light into the possession relation between the Ground and PLACE, and ultimately into the nature of PLACE itself: when PLACE and AxParts remain in situ an external possession relation yields, and the DP Ground is marked for genitive, while, if PLACE is moved/merged to the edge of DPPlace and AxPart is moved/merged in PPdir/stat, the Ground appears in a Construct State-like configuration with it. In addition, such configurations still emerge with pronominal Grounds, yet in a different marking, i. e. genitive, given the restrictor-less internal structure of pronouns.  All this entails that movement of AxParts, movement of PLACE and the internal structure of Ground are intimately related, and PLACE should be thought of as a sort of relational noun, as microcomparative data from Southern Italian varieties show that pronominal Grounds take the same possession marking of pronominal possessors of relational nouns such as kinship terms and/or body parts.

Thus despite the intrinsic limitations of gestures compared to full-fledged sign languages, they might access some of the same rules. While gesture research often focuses on co-speech gestures, which co-occur with spoken words, we focus instead on pro-speech gestures, which fully replace spoken words and thus often make a full-fledged semantic contribution, like signs. We argue that gestural loci can emulate several properties of sign language loci (= positions in signing space that realize discourse referents): there can be an arbitrary number of loci, with a distinction between speaker-, addressee- and third person-denoting loci. Gestural loci may be free or bound, and they may be used to realize 'donkey' anaphora, including with antecedents under negation. Some gestural verbs include loci in their realization, and for this reason they resemble some 'agreement verbs' found in sign language (Schlenker and Chemla, to appear). As in sign language, gestural loci can have rich iconic uses, with high loci used for tall individuals, and with the possibility of co-opting a location-denoting locus to refer to an individual found at that location ('Locative Shift'). Turning to plurality, we argue that repetition-based gestural nouns replicate some properties of repetition-based plurals in ASL (Schlenker and Lamberton 2017): unpunctuated repetitions provide vague information about quantities, punctuated repetitions are often semantically precise, and rich iconic information can be provided in both cases depending on the arrangement of the repetitions; we discuss some possible extensions to continuous repetitions found with some mass terms. We further suggest that gestural verbs can give rise to repetition-based pluractional readings, as their sign language counterparts (Kuhn 2015). Following Strickland et al. 2015, we further argue that a distinction between telic and atelic sign language verbs, involving the existence of sharp boundaries, can be replicated with gestural verbs.

We argue that the theoretical disagreement has an empirical underpinning. Roots may have syntactic features but this structural property interacts with derivational timing: if a root does not have any active syntactic features, then it must be Late Inserted. In contrast, roots with active syntac- tic features must be inserted early in order for those features to be available to syntactic computation. The empirical picture gets further complicated by the fact that the geometry of features on roots does not nec- essarily match the geometry of features in the extended functional domain.

Otaki, Sugisaki, Yusa, and Koizumi (2013) show that null subjects and objects in Kaqchikel are not interpreted as full noun phrases, and therefore not the result of argument ellipsis.

Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analysis of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reigned in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but obeying the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.',\n",

Here, we examine the influence of frequency and lexical semantic factors on English children’s acquisition of by-phrase passives. We conduct both a meta-analysis of experimental studies capturing the age of acquisition for the passive use of English verbs and a corpus analysis of English children’s input. We find no relationship at all between the demonstrated age of acquisition (AoA) and input frequency, whether we examine frequency of the individual verb in the passive or frequency of the individual verb in any form. However, there is a striking correlation between the lexical semantic profile of verbs and the AoA for their passive use by English-speaking children. Our findings suggest lexical semantics are a key variable impacting children’s performance on the English passive. We discuss promising future experimental, corpus, computational, and theoretical directions.\",\n",

This alternation has been known as a case epenthesis that challenges the existing theories of phonological markedness (Rice, 2008; Morley, 2015; Vaux & Samuels, 2015). The analysis of this alternation has also been debated (de Lacy, 2006; de Lacy & Kingston, 2013). This paper presents new fieldwork and experimental evidence showing that the reported epenthesis pattern fails to be generalized to new environments. The results go against the phonological insertion account of the alternation, and instead support the analysis of Buriat dorsal-zero alternation in terms of floating features, present only on the relevant native affixes. These results thus suggest that Buriat is not a counterexample to dorsal markedness. The fact that dorsal epenthesis is not generalized despite relatively robust native evidence is also consistent with a learning bias against unnatural alternations (White, 2014; Hayes & White, 2015).',\n",

In this paper we demonstrate that greater insights for a number of phenomena are achieved when analyzed with CV syllabification and onset consonants that are moraic, a possibility independently proposed for a wide range of languages by Topintzi (2010).

I develop an approach to these facts that forces DP copies to undergo partial deletion in the context of multiple copy spell-out, under the view that prnouns represent DPs with an absent or elided NP complement (Postal 1969; Elbourne 2001, 2005). Evidence for this approach comes from the observation that there are a variety of ways in which copied pronouns differ from ‘trueborn’ pronouns. Specifically, as I show for Dinka and a range of other patterns, copied pronouns may be imperfect copies, and display both featural mismatches and gaps (patterns in which only a subset of possible DPs are doubled by a pronoun).

       "  \"Head movement and its status as a type of movement that is available in the syntactic component of the grammar has been under discussion in the literature in recent years. This discussion sprang up in part as a result of head movement's apparent lack of semantic effects. Some researchers have attempted to place head movement outside of the domain of syntax. More recently, evidence of semantic effects of head movement has led others to reconsider such a move. In this dissertation, I provide evidence for head movement as a movement that must be available in the syntax. I show that the phenomenon of negative auxiliary inversion provides evidence for the semantic effect of head movement. Negative auxiliary inversion is a phenomenon present in some varieties of English spoken in North America. This study focuses on a particular variety of English, West Texas English, and is informed by the larger theoretical background at the syntax-semantics interface. The theoretical issues that are highly relevant are negation, subject restrictions of certain types of constructions, scope, and principles of scope economy. The movement that derives constructions which exhibit negative auxiliary inversion is sensitive to principles of scope economy and movement which is semantically vacuous is disallowed. The types of subjects that are possible in negative auxiliary inversion behave uniformly in their scopal interaction with negation. This discovery furthers our understanding of why subject restrictions arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the theoretical goals, this dissertation expands the empirical domain concerning microsyntactic variation in English. Although there are many apparent differences among varieties of English, very little theoretical work has been done on varieties other than Standard English. In this dissertation, I consider the varieties of English which allow the phenomenon and propose that the availability of negative auxiliary inversion is correlated with the availability of a higher negative projection in a variety's hierarchy of projections as well as the availability of negative concord. Additionally, I extend the analysis to account for transitive expletive constructions, another phenomenon which is present in some varieties which exhibit negative auxiliary inversion. The analysis is also extended to account for\\xa0Not-initial constructions, a phenomenon available to speakers of many varieties of English. I propose such constructions to be derived by movement, though the movement I propose it to involve is phrasal rather than head movement. This distinction allows me to account for cross-linguistic variation because not all varieties which exhibit\\xa0Not-initial constructions also exhibit negative auxiliary inversion constructions.\\r\\n\",\n",

I begin by introducing the puzzle posed by -men in Mandarin Chinese (henceforth Chinese), a suffix that has been widely analysed as a collective marker but demonstrates various features of a plural marker. I argue that neither analysis is satisfactory given the interaction of -men and dou, the latter of which can be analysed as the lexical representation of the Matching Function (Rothstein, 1995; henceforth the M-Function). Crucially, the collective analysis of -men fails to explain why it can co-occur with dou, which requires access to individual atoms, while the plural analysis of -men fails to predict many of its distributions and interpretations.\\r\\nIn light of these puzzles, I observe that when there is no overt universal quantifier in the sentence, nominals with -men turn out to be ambiguous between a strong and a weak reading, but they must receive a definite interpretation and have a “significant subpart” requirement, analogous to the semantic denotation of most of the X. This motivates the GQT treatment of - men which assumes covert quantification in its semantic representation. Moreover, the two readings of -men disambiguate in the presence of dou, with only the strong reading left, which further suggests the existence of a covert universal quantifier in -men, given that dou as the M-Function seeks a universal quantifier in the semantic composition (Pan, 2005; Zhang, 2007). To this end, I offer an alternative analysis in GQT terms that compares nominals with -men to most of the X, and further argue against the view that dou itself is a universal quantifier by addressing several persisting problems from previous accounts.',\n",

I first show that in a double topicalisation construction, the base- generated topic must precede the moved topic, which can be explained by the locality constraint that places a shortness requirement on movement, following the idea of minimal effort (Li, 2000). Secondly, when both topics are derived via movement, their dependency relations with the corresponding gaps in the comment clause must be ‘nested’. This can be accounted for by the Path Containment Constraint proposed by Pesetsky (1982), which requires the paths of movement to be in a containment relation. These findings challenge the view that Chinese topics are merely constrained via a semantic “aboutness” relation with the comment clause (cf. Xu & Langendoen, 1985), suggesting that topicalisation in Mandarin Chinese is subject to syntactic constraints.',\n",

In previous work, comparatives with clausal standards have been uniformly analyzed cross-linguistically as involving an A'-movement step abstracting over a degree variable, and thereby predicted to not occur in languages without degree abstraction. The paper shows that clausal comparison without degree abstraction is not only theoretically possible but attested, contributing to the cross-linguistic typology of degree constructions.\\n\\nI first present evidence from bǐ comparatives involving various types of movement chains, which shows that a phrasal analysis is untenable. I detail the comparative deletion enforced in bǐ comparatives and show that various properties of bǐ comparatives fall out of general constraints on ellipsis parallelism.

Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that more than one structural element can be the source of the valued features, and that the struc- turally higher element tends to be responsible for the semantically informed value (for instance, √ and n in Kramer 2009, see Pesetsky 2013 and Landau 2016 for related configurational analyses). Yet it is far from clear what it means for fea- tures to be valued from the ‘context,’ and why the structural height of functional heads should make a difference with respect to whether or not a syntactic feature is going to be semantically interpreted.\\r\\nThis paper brings into the debate new data from Standard Italian and uses it to argue for a novel treatment of semantically interpretable φ-features, specifically gender. The Standard Italian nominal system morphologically marks two distinct genders, three distinct nominal classes (idiosyncratic nominal endings), and two numbers, a combination which lends itself to a theoretical investigation of com- plex gender interactions. Crucially, Italian nominal inflection also distinguishes between grammatical, i.e., idiosyncratic, and natural, i.e., context-dependent, gender. The main empirical focus of the paper is on names of professions that exhibit morpho-syntactically varied behavior: for some speakers, the root chirurg- ‘sur- geon’ can denote a female even if it is grammatically masculine (il chirurgo ‘the.M surgeon’1), while other speakers prefer a derived form with a distinct morpholog- ical feminine marker, be it a feminine determiner, or a combination of a feminine determiner and a feminine ending on the noun (la chirurgo ‘the.F surgeon’ vs la chirurg-a ‘the.F surgeon-F). Some nouns, such as avvocato ‘lawyer,’ have the same range of the formal variation, even though there is a designated feminine de- rived noun (avvocatessa ‘female lawyer’).

It is compared with Roberts and Roussou (R&R) (2003) and van Gelderen's (2004, 2011) Minimalist analyses of grammaticalization (henceforth 'standard' grammaticalization (SG)) and\\r\\nwhile both display 'structural simplification', as defined by R&R (2003:198-201) and van Gelderen (2011:13-21), LG does not display 'upward feature analysis', which is a diagnostic trait of SG (R&R (2003:200)). Rather, there is 'lateral feature analysis' where one functional category (e.g. D) is re-analysed as another (e.g. T) (S&W (2002:201-202)).Furthermore, while examples of SG regularly display semantic and morphophonological weakening (R&R (2003:218-229)), those of LG do not, which seems to suggest that 'upward feature analysis', not 'lateral feature analysis', is the cause behind weakening in grammaticalization. Bybee (2003, 2011) proposes that frequency is the main driving force behind weakening in grammaticalization, since as the grammaticalizing element undergoes weakening in semantics, it becomes compatible with a wider range of complements and hence rises in frequency which causes it to become automatised and lose morphophonological substance. There is therefore a causal relationship between semantic and morphophonological weakening ('parallel reduction hypothesis'/'co-evolution of meaning and substance' (Bybee et al (1994:17-21)). In my comparison between the Romance future (Latin infinitive + habere) (SG) and the Chinese copula shi (LG), it is discovered that 'upward feature analysis' in SG does indeed give rise to 'context expansion', namely a widening in the range of complementation (cf Bybee (2003)), which leads to rise in frequency and morphophonological weakening, while 'lateral feature analysis' in LG crucially leads to 'context reduction' which lowers the frequency of the grammaticalizing element and hence pre-empts its morphophonological weakening. Cross-linguistic patterns of weakening are examined and there seems to be a correlation between frequency effects in syntactic change and the rate of morphophonological weakening in functional elements. This is significant, since it is widely assumed that functional elements are necessarily weak (cf Selkirk (1984:335-337)) when the evidence from a formal analysis of grammaticalization suggests that the empirical properties of functional elements, namely their differential rates of weakening, can (and should) be derived from their genesis, namely grammaticalization (SG/LG). This opens up new research questions which are left for future investigations.\",\n",

Existing proposals derive V1 order in Mayan by base-generating the subject in a vP-internal right-side specifier (Aissen 1992) or by XP-fronting a predicate to a high left-side specifier position (Coon 2010). We review problems with previous accounts and argue that V1 is consistently derived by head movement of the verb to a position above the subject and below Infl0. This proposal accounts for uniformity in verb-stem formation across the family and provides a natural account of VSO orders. Next, we turn to VOS-VSO alternating languages, where a variety of factors have been reported to determine postverbal argument order, including specificity, definiteness, phonological weight, discourse prominence, and argument animacy (see e.g. England 1991). After an in-depth examination of these factors, we suggest that there are three distinct and independently motivated paths to VOS order in the Mayan family. First, based on prosodic evidence from Ch’ol, we argue that VOS may be derived by postsyntactic reordering of NP objects (Clemens 2014). In addition, VOS may arise through right-side subject topicalization (Can Pixabaj 2004; Curiel 2007) or the shifting of heavy subjects towards the periphery of the clause (Larsen 1988). This account both provides better empirical coverage internal to Ch’ol, and makes testable predictions in the domains of word order and prosodic constituency for other Mayan languages.',\n",

Some diachronic data are found to support Rizzi’s (1997) left periphery proposal. But a question that becomes pertinent from some other data concerns what the hierarchy is between the perfective aspect and the imperfective aspect. The paper finally shows that the combination of the methods of Historical Linguistics with those of generative theories to account for diachronic changes leads to greater theoretical refinement.',\n",

For instance, why can we say \"I ran for five minutes\" but not \"*I ran to the store for five minutes\"? Why is \"five pounds of books\" acceptable, but \"*five pounds of book\" not acceptable? What prevents us from saying \"*sixty degrees of water\" to express the temperature of the water in a swimming pool when \"sixty inches of water\" can express its depth? And why can we not say \"*all the ants in my kitchen are numerous\"? The constraints on these constructions involve concepts that are generally studied separately: aspect, plural and mass reference, measurement, and distributivity. In this book, Lucas Champollion provides a unified perspective on these domains, connects them formally within the framework of algebraic semantics and mereology, and uses this connection to transfer insights across unrelated bodies of literature and formulate a single constraint that explains each of the judgments above.

While each event is in some sense a singular unique occurrence, we generally talk about them as happening in a certain way with particular consequences, carrying on or ending after some amount of time, and involving different participants who bear particular relationships to the event. These conceptually general and grammatically relevant properties of events are captured in theories of event structure. The goal of such theories is to explain the patterns in meaning that arise from the structural aspects of language. Event structures do this by decomposing an individual event into a set of subevents which stand in particular relationships to one another. These component subevents and their relationships are often encoded in independently articulated linguistic constituents that are scattered throughout a sentence. As a result, these components must be recovered and put back together for a comprehender to properly understand the event that a sentence denotes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis chapter examines how some of the grammatically-determined interpretations arising from event structure unfold in real time, with a focus on sentence processing.

First, they can give rise to so-called non-maximal readings, in the sense that they ‘allow for exceptions’ ('Mary read the books on the reading list', in some contexts, can be judged true even if Mary didn’t read all the books on the reading list). Second, while they tend to have a quasi-universal quantificational force in affirmative sentences (‘quasi-universal’ rather than simply ‘universal’ due to the possibility of exceptions we have just mentioned), they tend to be interpreted existentially in the scope of negation (a property often referred to as homogeneity, cf. Löbner 2000). Building on previous works (in particular Krifka 1996 and Malamud 2012), we offer a theory in which sentences containing plural definite expressions trigger a family of possible interpretations, and where general principles of language use account for their interpretation in various contexts and syntactic environments. Our theory solves a number of problems that these previous works encounter, and has broader empirical coverage in that it offers a precise analysis for sentences that display complex interactions between plural definites, quantifiers and bound variables, as well as for cases involving non-distributive predicates. The resulting proposal is briefly compared with an alternative proposal by Križ (2016), which has similar coverage but is based on a very different architecture and sometimes makes subtly different predictions.\",\n",

       "  ', has been the subject of intense research, and controversy, over the last few decades. The classic approach to numerical interpretation, pioneered by Horn (1972), contends that the basic, literal meaning of | is ‘at least three’ (a one-sided meaning), and that the upper bound it typically implies arises by way of scalar implicature. More recent approaches argue that the literal meaning of | is ‘exactly three’ (a two-sided meaning), implemented in one of a variety of ways (e.g. Geurts 2006; Breheny 2008; Kennedy 2015). With a few exceptions, the primary data set has, up to now, consisted of simple existential sentences with distributive predicates, as well as modal sentences. The goal of this article is to reassess these two basic approaches to numerals (the ‘at least’ approach and a representative family of ‘exactly’ approaches) in light of a broader range of data that includes existential sentences with collective predicates, such as | (cf. Link 1987, 1991). I show that a brand new puzzle emerges: on the one hand, (a version of) the classic account gets the collective facts exactly right, but it fails to predict a previously unnoticed asymmetry in the distribution of two-sided readings of numerical indefinites embedded under a downward-entailing operator; on the other hand, (a version of) the ‘exactly’ approach beautifully predicts the embedding facts, but overgenerates in the collective domain. I conclude by offering some speculation as to how the puzzle might be resolved in favor of the classic account.',\n",

This thesis explores the hypothesis that all generalizations regarding the distribution of nasal-stop sequences can be explained by explicitly referencing contrast, and presents the results of multiple cross-linguistic studies designed to test that hypothesis. I show first that taking into consideration cues to the contrasts between nasal-stop sequences and their component parts (nasals and stops) allows us to accurately predict generalizations regarding the distribution of phonemic nasal-stop sequences (i.e. those that are phonemically contrastive with other segment types). Following this I show that taking into consideration cues to the contrast between oral and nasal vowels allows us to accurately predict generalizations regarding the distribution of allophonic nasal-stop sequences (i.e. those not phonemically contrastive with other segment types), as well as generalizations regarding the distribution of phonemic nasal-stop sequences in the context of phonemically nasal and allophonically nasalized vowels. Broadly, the results presented here contribute to a larger body of evidence that constraints on contrast are a necessary component of the synchronic phonological grammar (following e.g. Lindblom 1986; Flemming 2002, 2008; Padgett 2009).',\n",

Secondly, this pronoun-case-agreement order contrasts with the order found in garden variety possessive structures: ordinary possessive DPs feature the order noun-agreement-case. The goal of this paper is to offer an account of these puzzling phenomena. I argue that a PP structure in which PPs are projected from a silent place noun and the Ground is merged as the possessor of place (Terzi, 2005, 2008, 2010; Botwinik-Rotem, 2008; Botwinik-Rotem and Terzi, 2008; Pantcheva, 2008; Cinque, 2010a; Noonan, 2010, and Nchare and Terzi, 2014) allows an elightening analysis of the appearance and position of the possessive agreement in PPs. I also discuss how certain surface differences between PPs and ordinary possessive constructions can be accounted for while maintaining the possessive analysis of PPs. By showing that a PP structure with a possessive core yields a natural account of the intricate Hungarian data, the paper strengthens the case for a possessive-based approach to PPs in Universal Grammar.',\n",

We compare pronominal anaphora with a bare noun to similar anaphora supported by a regular indefinite and ask to what extent bare nouns share the hallmark property of regular indefinites in supporting pronominal anaphora. We have found that bare nouns support pronominal anaphora, just like regular indefinites, but with increased processing effort. This finding is compatible with the view that bare nouns are 'translucent' in discourse (Farkas & de Swart 2003, Dayal 2011); that is, they are neither completely transparent nor completely opaque in discourse. Our conclusion invites investigations to pin down the cause of discourse translucency of bare nouns.\",\n",

The approach uses layered foot representations to capture ternary phenomena, following Martinez-Paricio and Kager (forthcoming). A set of licensing and structural constraints regulate tone-feet interactions. Harmonic Serialism is adopted as the grammatical framework, to allow for an account of opaque patterns (Prince and Smolensky 1993; McCarthy 2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present approach improves on previous accounts in two ways. Firstly, the size of the tonal bounding domain follows from independently motivated foot representations, rather than being stipulated in the constraint set. Secondly, the approach obviates the need for markedness constraints that refer to underlying structure, because all relevant lexical information is reflected in foot structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe approach is demonstrated on Saghala (Patin 2009). Saghala shows both shift and spread in a trisyllabic domain. There are six tone patterns, dependent on the contact or near-contact of tones, and the position of word boundaries. An analysis is presented which accounts for all patterns. The success of the analysis shows that the foot-based approach is equipped to deal with a variety of bounded tone phenomena.',\n",

Frederick Klaeber defines Old English motan as “may, have opportunity, be allowed”, all of which are quite different from the modern “must”. To explain the patterns of usage of motan in ninth-century Old English, Igor Yanovich convincingly proposes that the verb really had only one sense somewhere between “may” and “must”, and that its range of translations arises from the fact that this meaning is hard to express in modern English. Yanovich’s analysis, however, was limited to the ninth-century corpus of Alfredian texts, so he did not discuss whether the semantics of the verb, which had already mutated dramatically by Chaucer, remained the same in other Old English works. Beowulf is a good Old English text in which to examine the usage of motan for several reasons. Firstly, it is quite long, so there are many occurrences of what is a remarkably infrequent modal verb. In addition, it has several unclear passages containing motan, so any insight about the verb’s general meaning in the language of the poem could help explain these sections. Finally, the dating of  Beowulf  is hotly contested. Thus, placing the poem’s use of motan within a timeline of development could offer clues about when the poem was composed. After examining many occurrences of motan within  Beowulf , it is clear that the usage of motan fits the schema observed by Yanovich in Alfredian Old English. Moreover, Yanovich’s semantics for motan offer insight about how we should interpret several of the notoriously unclear passages in  Beowulf.',\n",

Models using different sets of constructs are compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion, which assesses the accuracy and complexity of each model. The principal results are that: (1) transitional probabilities are better modeled using root-motion and chord-frequency information than they are using pairs of individual chords; (2) transitional probabilities are better described using a mixture model intermediate in complexity between a bigram and full trigram model; and (3) the difference between occurring and non-occurring chords is more efficiently modeled with a hierarchical, recursive context-free grammar than it is as a Markov chain.

       "  \"Attributive adjectives have a number of properties that distinguish them from predicative adjectives and other modifiers of the noun. For example, attributives are subject to ordering restrictions that do not apply to other types of nominal modifier, and they exhibit scope interactions unlike predicatives or relative clauses. This thesis argues that these properties are best captured by an analysis in which all attributives share the same relationship with the noun and discusses the ways in which our understanding of a number of phenomena at the edges of attribution must change.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne influential theory of adjective ordering restrictions (discussed in Larson 2000a and Cinque 2010, among others) holds that violations of the ordering hierarchy that applies to many attributive adjectives are due to the existence of modifiers that superficially look like attributives but are in fact derived from reduced relative clauses. These derived attributives are merged higher than underived attributives and are unordered with respect to each other. I show that the offending adjectives do not behave syntactically like true relative clauses, whether full or reduced. In addition, while all attributive semantics is asymmetric, true relatives involve symmetric modification. This single-source approach entails a rethinking of some of the effects commonly understood to result from attribution. I will address two such effects, which could be taken as evidence in favour of a derived attributive approach to attribution, and show that they are best analyzed using a homogeneous approach to attribution. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn languages where the noun follows its modifiers, the ordering of AP and PP modifiers is free and their scope varies with c-command. In noun-initial languages their order is fixed, with the AP preceding other modifiers, and their scope is ambiguous. This pattern could be taken as evidence for a second source of adnominal modification, if the high position of the AP in noun-final languages is a reduced relative clause. However, I show that both the ordering and scope effects are due to a novel constraint restricting the linear order of attributive and other modifiers. The ordering patterns of AP and PP modifiers are therefore not evidence for the existence of derived attributives.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne piece of evidence for the dual-source theory of attribution is that some adjectives have unexpectedly rigid requirements for adjacency and nonintersectivity (for example, in the phrase 'hard worker'). I demonstrate that  cases like these are not true attribution but are instead a type of bracketing paradox. I argue that these bracketing paradoxes are derived by movement at LF. This movement (and indeed all movement) is restricted in the type of information that must be retained before and after the operation takes place, but is otherwise free. Therefore, these examples do not provide evidence for two different types of attributive modifier. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed analysis of attribution allows for a simplification of adjectival modification, as it does not require a distinction between derived and underived attributive adjectives. The analysis presented in this thesis entails a novel categorization of certain adjectival phenomena, but readily accounts for the empirical intricacies of attribution.  \",\n",

Specifically, we will argue that, contrary to what is standardly assumed, the factors conditioning the EPP are actually not syntactic, but phonological, as has also been proposed by others in the literature. Nonetheless, the operations that it seems to trigger clearly are syntactic. This sheds light on why the EPP has been so difficult to get a handle on, but it also presents a conundrum, as it seems to suggest that aspects of the syntactic derivation depend on phonological information. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the  broadly Minimalist framework we adopt here, this would be clearly countercyclic. In the standard Y-model and its descendants, the output of the (narrow) syntactic derivation feeds into the interpretive components of PF and LF, thus while syntactic information feeds into PF, phonological information is not available to the syntax. More recent phase-based and multiple Spell-out models introduce a certain amount of feedback, such that syntactic cycles may be interleaved with non-syntactic ones, but it is normally not assumed that phonological information from previous cycles can actually interact with later syntactic cycles. Indeed, the crucial point here is not specific to the Y-model. Rather, it extends to any framework which assumes that the syntactic derivation does not have access to the phonological properties of the structures it manipulates, e.g. as a general principle of modularity or because phonological content is explicitly inserted at a late stage of the derivation after the narrow syntax has done its work. The EPP thus seems to involve a violation of modularity or counter-cyclicity. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which must simultaneously be able to handle its unique properties but must also be made to fit in with the broader theory of grammatical architecture. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will argue that such an approach will not only allow a more satisfactory account of the EPP itself, but can also yield a unification with the comp-trace effect and yield insight into how both of these interact with pro-drop.

In this paper I consider how syntactic trees as such can be recursively linearized with tree traversal/walk algorithm familiar in computer science. I show that for tree walk to be applicable to an inherently unordered syntactic tree, an asymmetry has to be established between the two subtrees of a parent tree, so that the latter may be unambiguously co-labeled with exactly one of its subtrees. In modifying Chomsky’s (2013,\\xa02015) labeling algorithm to serve the purpose, I discuss the implications the label-based linearization theory has for the labeling algorithm itself and for the syntactic phenomena it has been used to account for.

The similarity of the V3 patterns found in these new varieties, which are geographically isolated from each other but which share a characterization in terms of the demographics of their speaker groups, invites a diachronic account in terms of language contact. I argue that transfer cannot account for V3, but that a scenario of sequential simplification and complexification is able to do so.

Consequently, the compositional interaction of polysemous prepositions with other parts of speech can determine which specific sense emerges in a sentence.

It addresses data that have not previously been analysed in the literature, involving so-called Boolean constructions (e.g. en la estación y la calle).

I show, first, that the phenomenon is not just syntactical (pace Hofmann 1966; Perlmutter 1970b; Ross 1969; Jackendoff 1972; Butler 2003; Hacquard\\r\\n2006, 2009; among many others): the variation in the interpretation (epistemic vs. deontic) is the result of differences in the argument structure (raising vs. control) of the modal auxiliary verbs. The key, I argue is causation, which triggers a shift from pure necessity, to intention as force (in\\r\\nthe sense of Copley et al. (2015), i.e., as a field generating force. In Greek, the epistemic and deontic reading of the necessity modal comes about in a conceptual causal frame, where the two clauses are connected with the subjunctive particle na ‘to/that’— a pattern that we find also in\\r\\nother languages, including English, at least with some performative verbs such as agree, insist where the different modal reading are visible through complement choice. The current analysis implies a meaning of modality richer than mere argument structure (raising vs. control); and, by capitalizing on the causal frame and the presence of force in modal structures, the analysis\\r\\nenables a principled explanation of the shift to intention-necessity without positing ambiguity for the necessity verb prepi.',\n",

It is shown that these types of readings emerge as the result of prepositions interacting with other parts of speech, such as verbs, DPs and temporal adverbs (e.g., in one hour). Two types of understudied data are discussed. The first set of data involves the interaction of literal and metaphoric readings with lexical aspect, including their distribution with temporal adverbs (e.g., in one hour/for one hour). The second set of data involves the co-existence of literal and metaphoric readings for prepositions in coordinated structures (e.g., under the table and through the briefing). The account suggests that both readings emerge as types of possible relations that spatial prepositions can denote, as part of a complex semantic domain that includes distinct semantic dimensions.',\n",

In particular, it was tested whether children’s choice between the prepositional dative construction and the double object construction (the so-called “dative alternation”) with the verb give was influenced by (i) the discourse givenness and topicality of themes and recipients, (ii) the situational necessity of contrast, and (iii) the use of the expected construction by the child’s interlocutor (prompt). The results provide evidence for the role of all factors, showing that four-and-a-half-year-olds are sensitive to the distinction between topics and foci and are able to produce contrastive topicalization. Although children did not produce an adult-like rate of contrastive topicalization strategies (which is tentatively explained by their underuse of gapping constructions), they did reveal adult-like preferences with respect to the choice of a dative construction that better matches the context. Children’s sensitivity to contrast is evidenced by the fact that children more frequently employed contrastive topicalization strategies as conditions increasingly required so — as well as the fact that in the presence of contrastive topicalization, topics and foci alike were categorically expressed as full noun phrases rather than pronouns. The paper provides further evidence for children’s early pragmatic competence, especially active knowledge of contrastive topicalization, demonstrated in their adult-like, pragmatic-sensitive use of the dative alternation. This study thus contributes to the investigation of the interface between syntax and Information Structure in language acquisition.',\n",

Prosodic smothering arises when the prosodic status of a clitic or affix varies with the presence or absence of some outer morpheme. We first illustrate prosodic smothering with novel data from two genetically unrelated languages, Macedonian (Slavic) and Kaqchikel (Mayan). We then provide a unified account of prosodic smothering based on a principled extension of the theory of prosodic subcategorization (Inkelas 1990, Peperkamp 1997, Chung 2003, Yu 2003, Paster 2006, Bye 2007, among others). Prosodic subcategorization typically involves requirements placed on items to the left or the right of the selecting morpheme. We show that prosodic smothering naturally emerges in a theory which also allows for subcategorization in the vertical dimension, such that morphemes may select for the prosodic category which immediately dominates them in surface prosodic structure. This extension successfully reduces two apparent cases of non-local prosodic conditioning to the effects of strictly local prosodic selection.',\n",

Open-mid allophones have consistently higher F1 realizations and more central F2 realizations than their close-mid counterparts, but are not consistently shorter. These results are problematic for accounts of the loi de position as a pattern of vowel reduction, with mid-vowel lowering and centralizing being caused by shortening. F1 and F2 distances between close-mid and open-mid allophones vary across different prosodic and consonantal contexts and these variations can be analyzed as resulting from duration-based undershoot. More broadly, the results have implications for the typology of closed-syllable vowel laxing: they suggest that tense and lax realizations cannot generally be derived from the same acoustic target via closed-syllable vowel shortening but have distinct acoustic targets.',\n",

Two contrasting views of the role of lexical meaning in the analysis of such variation can be found in the literature: (i) uniformity, whereby lexical meaning is universal, and variation arises from idiosyncratic differences in the inventory and phonological shape of language-particular functional material, and (ii) transparency, whereby systematic variation in form arises from systematic variation in the meaning of basic lexical items. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this volume, Itamar Francez and Andrew Koontz-Garboden contrast these views as applied to the empirical domain of property concept sentences - sentences expressing adjectival predication and their translational equivalents across languages. They demonstrate that property concept sentences vary systematically between possessive and predicative form, and propose a transparentist analysis of this variation that links it to the lexical denotations of basic property concept lexemes. At the heart of the analysis are qualities: mass-like model theoretic objects that closely resemble scales. The authors contrast their transparentist analysis with uniformitarian alternatives, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical advantages. They then show that the proposed theory of qualities can account for interesting and novel observations in two central domains of grammatical theory: the theory of syntactic categories, and the theory of mass nouns. The overall results highlight the importance of the lexicon as a locus of generalizations about the limits of crosslinguistic variation. ',\n",

This paper explores the granularity with which these verbs\\' semantic and pragmatic properties are recoverable from their syntactic distributions, using three behavioral experiments aimed at explicitly quantifying the relationship between these two sets of properties. Experiment 1 gathers a measure of 30 propositional attitude verbs\\' syntactic distributions using an acceptability judgment task. Experiments 2a and 2b gather measures of semantic similarity between those same verbs using a generalized semantic discrimination (triad or \"odd man out\") task and an ordinal (Likert) scale task, respectively. Two kinds of analyses are conducted on the data from these experiments. The first compares both the acceptability judgments and the semantic similarity judgments to previous classifications derived from the syntax and semantics literature. The second kind compares the acceptability judgments to the semantic similarity judgments directly. Through these comparisons, we show that there is quite fine-grained information about propositional attitude verbs\\' semantics carried in their syntactic distributions – whether one considers the sorts of discrete qualitative classifications that linguists traditionally work with or the sorts of continuous quantitative classifications that can be derived experimentally.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: a previous version of this manuscript, entitled \"Projecting attitudes\", was previously submitted to LingBuzz.

We choose to establish an equivalence between intensions and syntactic nodes by defining the sense of a node as the node itself. Then, we define the English word “that” as a sense abstractor: in other words, it returns as a referent the sense of the clause that it introduces. We also allow a new lambda theoretic type for LF-subtrees so that denotations of words can take intensions as arguments. Thus, this formalism gives us an alternative way of dealing with intensionality. As we show with example derivations of relative clause structures and sentences with “only”, it also handles trace binding and alternative-sensitive words without special-case composition rules like predicate abstraction. Thus, we can understand sense abstraction as a formal framework that unifies our treatment of intensionality, predicate abstraction, and alternative semantics.\\r\\n',\n",

In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed taxonomy identifies rhyme and ablaut reduplication as the only productive, truly reduplicative processes in the morphology of German. All other contemplable cases of reduplicative structures are properly treated as either phonological doubling, lexical sequencing or (special cases of) compounding. An OT analysis is offered which suggests that both rhyme and ablaut reduplication may emerge when a segmentally and prosodically unspecified expressive morpheme is attached to a base - given that the base strictly obeys certain word prosodic requirements.\\r\\nThe present approach eschews constraints that make explicit reference to base-reduplicant correspondence. The OT grammar successfully models the emergence of the fixed bipedal structure, the obligatory segmental deviance of the reduplicant, non-exponence of the expressive morpheme in the case of non-trochaic bases, the variable linearization of base and reduplicant in ablaut reduplication, and the interaction of reduplication with i) segmental alternations and ii) onset complexity.\\r\\nCertain (cross-linguistic) correlations regarding constraints on reduplicative word formation and poetic devices, such as rhyme and meter, are discussed.',\n",

       "  \"Adopting a constructionist approach, this paper articulates a proposal about how syntax encodes the fundamental parameters of noun lexical semantics: entity type, part structure, atomicity, and numerosity, represented at different syntactic loci. It is claimed that the naming (not describing) of an entity type is what makes a noun a noun (formally, what turns a root into a noun). An ‘entity type’ is understood as an e-type element in the speaker’s ontology, not yet determined as denoting over kinds or their object instances. Higher projections turn this into a predicate, and further grammatical specifications may restrict its reference to what is modelled as elements of a partition, or as atoms, but without a single countability switch. Whether the reference is to kinds or to instances depends on all the specifications that jointly define a division of reference. In particular, plurality enforces an instance reading where the partition it determines is based on spatiotemporally situated parts, in the absence of other criteria for individuality. Beside determining what types of plurals may not license a kind reading, this view of the division of reference analyzes fake mass nouns ('furniture') as a count structure inside a mass shell, which predictively relates their semantics to their morphology. The same analytical framework, with no additional stipulations, explains the properties of non-countable plural nouns, both arising from mass nouns ('waters') and from non-nominal bases ('beginnings'). Finally, a case of mixed-gender DP shows that unexpected interactions between gender and number can be interpreted as cases where the determination of an agreement class is bound up with the determination of part structure. \",\n",

These constructions, however, differ from each other in one important way: Romanian passive se allows a by-phrase, while Spanish passive se shows severe restrictions. Moreover, we illustrate that in Old Spanish, passive se freely allowed by-phrases. Thus, Modern Romanian reflects an earlier stage of Spanish. We propose a linguistic cycle to explain these differences, where Spanish and Romanian are at different stages of that cycle. The approach offers an explanation for a general pattern within Romance where by-phrases are initially grammatical with passive se, but then become ungrammatical over time, a pattern to date that has not been explained.  It also offers a thereotical account for why some languages do not develop passive se constructions. ',\n",

       "  'We provide an analysis of focus and exhaustive focus in the Grassfields Bantu language Awing. We show that Awing provides an exceptionally clear window into the syntactic properties of exhaustive focus. Our analysis reveals that the Awing particle LE realizes a left-peripheral head which, in terms of its syntactic position in the functional sequence, closely corresponds to the Foc(us) head in standard cartographic analyses (e.g. Rizzi 1997). Crucially, however, we show that LE is only used if the focus it associates with receives a presuppositional exhaustive (cleft-like) interpretation. Other types of focus are not formally encoded in Awing. In order to reflect this semantic specification of LE, we call its syntactic category Exh rather than Foc. Another point of difference from what one would consider a \"standard\" cartographic Foc head is that the focus associated with LE is not realized in its specifier but rather within its complement. More particularly, we argue that LE associates with the closest maximal projection it asymmetrically c-commands. The broader theoretical relevance of the present work is at least two-fold. First, our paper offers novel evidence in support of Horvath\\'s (2010) Strong Modularity Hypothesis for Discourse Features, according to which information structural notions such as focus cannot be represented in narrow syntax as formal features. We argue that the information structure-related movement operations that Awing exhibits can be accounted for by interface considerations, in the spirit of Reinhart (2006). Second, our data support the generality of the so called closeness requirement on association with focus Jacobs (1983), which dictates that a focus-sensitive particle be as close to its focus as possible (in terms of c-command). What is of special significance is the fact that Awing exhibits two different avenues to satisfying closeness. The standard one - previously described for German or Vietnamese and witnessed here for the Awing particle TSOE \\'only\\' - relies primarily on the flexible attachment of the focus-sensitive particle. The Awing particle LE, in contrast, is syntactically rigid. For that reason, the satisfaction of closeness relies solely on the flexibility of other syntactic constituents.',\n",

Building on Hernanz (2007 and subsequent work), we propose that sí, which marks focal affirmative polarity, originates in ΣP and then moves to FocusP. By contrast, sí que is directly merged in AssertiveP in the left periphery, since it emphasizes the truth of the proposition. Thus, we argue that sí que involves more CP structure than sí, which makes a variety of correct empirical predictions. Additionally, several facts indicate that sí que behaves much like a predicate of truth, which further substantiates the AssertiveP analysis advocated here. We then investigate the possibility that que in such contexts also performs an echoic function, along the lines of Demonte & Fernández-Soriano (2014). More generally, the findings reported here allow us to draw a more accurate mapping of the Spanish left periphery, a topic of much discussion in the Romance literature. \\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

Whether a grammatical object is an affix, or a clitic, or a prefix is something that is idiosyncratically indicated for each morpheme in its lexical entry. However, certain generalizations about the morphology of some grammatical objects suggest that an alternative way of thinking about the identity of morphological objects is needed. It seems to be the case that (at least) some grammatical objects have the morphological identity they do because of the syntactic configuration they must appear in. With this background, in this paper, we claim that a topic marker or a focus sensitive particle cannot be an affix. This follows from two assumptions: (1) the projections of the topic or focus(sensitive) heads cannot form head-chains with their complement and (2) affixhood is the interpretation (i.e. the spell-out) of head adjunction. We conclude that affixhood should not be taken to be a primitive concept of the linguistic analysis.',\n",

Empirically, we closely examine hitherto unexplored verb “triplets” (Suga, 1980; de Chene, 2016), in which the same lexical roots are shared by multiple transitive/intransitive verbs with different transitivity morphology, and reveal their differential syntactic behaviors in the interpretation of external arguments (between multiple transitive verbs sharing the same root) and unaccusativity (between multiple intransitive verbs sharing the same root). Theoretically, within the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz, 1993), we propose the system in which transitivity morphology, previously identified as little v (Volpe, 2005; Harley, 2008; Marantz, 2013), is analyzed as Voice morphology differently specified regarding the presence/absence of external arguments (Schafer, 2008; Marantz, 2013; Wood, 2015; Alexiadou et al., 2015), and explain the syntax of transitivity alternations. Furthermore, the proposed Voice system will be extended to the broader empirical domain of Japanese argument structures and derive ditransitive verbs, “figure ditransitive” verbs, and syntactic causatives/passives. Finally, we discuss several theoretical consequences of our proposal concerning (i) lexical vs. syntactic approaches to argument structure, (ii) the distinctness of Voice and little v (Harley, 2013; Legate, 2014), and (iii) the unification of argument-introducing functional heads under i* (Wood & Marantz, 2017).',\n",

To this end, I present evidence from a linguistic phenomenon where grammatical perspective has long been observed to play a central role — namely, non-local anaphora (a cover-term not only for long-distance anaphora and backward anaphora but also for logophora). The evidence that I provide comes primarily from Tamil, a language of the Dravidian family, spoken predominantly in parts of South India. Non-local anaphora in Tamil, like in Icelandic, Italian, Japanese and in its fellow Dravidian language Malayalam, is perspective-driven: i.e. the antecedent of a successfully bound anaphor must denote a mental or spatio-temporal perspective-holder toward some predication containing the anaphor. However, unlike the other languages mentioned here, Tamil provides compelling evidence in the form of verbal agreement that the perspective that regulates anaphoric dependencies is syntactically represented. In particular, I will argue that the agreement marking that obtains on the clausemate verb of the anaphor in Tamil, when this anaphor occurs in nominative case (the case that generally feeds agreement), seems to be anomalously triggered, not by the anaphor or by its antecedent, but by a silent perspectival pronoun local to the verb. Assuming that agreement is a morphosyntactic process, such a thesis, if correct, then entails that perspective must be syntactically (i.e. structurally and featurally) instantiated.',\n",

This paper also emphasizes that this neutral value on a scale is not an 'extension gap', but rather the intersection of two 'negative extensions'. The formalism of the analysis is implemented with interval arithmetic.

However, we contend that greater restrictiveness can be achieved through morphotactic constraints and repairs in the Generalized Reduplication formalism, triggered by a Noninitiality condition on the positioning of the plural affix, and develop a set of conditions on these operations that situate the locus of interspeaker variation within the postsyntactic component.',\n",

       "  'In many languages with ergative morphology, transitive subjects(i.e. ergatives) are unable to undergo A’-extraction. This extraction asymmetry is a common hallmark of “syntactic ergativity,” and is found in a range of typologically diverse languages (see e.g. Deal 2016; Polinsky to appear, and works cited there). In Kaqchikel, the A’-extraction of transitive subjects requires a special verb form, known in Mayanist literature as Agent Focus (AF). In a recent paper, Erlewine (2015) argues the restriction on A’-extracting transitive subjects in Kaqchikel is the result of an Anti-Locality effect: transitive subjects are not permitted to extract because they are too close to C. This analysis relies crucially on Erlewine’s proposal that transitive subjects undergo movement to Spec,IP while intransitive subjects remain low. For Erlewine, this derives the fact that transitive (ergative) subjects, but not intransitive (absolutive) subjects are subject to extraction restrictions. Furthermore, it makes the strong prediction that phrasal material intervening between IP and CP should obviate the need for AF in clauses with subject extraction. In this paper, we argue against the Anti-Locality analysis of ergative A’-extraction restrictions along two lines. First, we raise concerns with the proposal that transitive, but not intransitive subjects, move to Spec,IP. Our second, and main focus, is to show that there is variation in whether AF is observed in configurations intervening phrasal material, with a primary focus on intervening adverbs. We propose an alternative account for the variation in whether AF is observed in the presence of adverbs and discuss consequences for accounts of ergative extraction asymmetries more generally.',\n",

The characteristic property of this pattern is the sometimes implicit, but often overt and obligatory presence of a locative PP which embeds a body-part noun in a VP which is otherwise monotransitive. Figure reflexive constructions are syntactically unified by the fact that their internal argument is conceptualized as a prepositional small clause, which introduces the Figure-Ground relation. These constructions are also Voiced, in the sense that an external argument position is projected even if it may be non-thematic. Unaccusatives are analyzed as introducing an expletive, i.e. non-thematic Voice projection, whose role is simply to signal that the event structure of transitives and derived unaccusatives is the same, consisting of a causing subevent and a result state. The discussion of unaccusatives is theoretically relevant in that it strengthens the suggestion that there is a connection between the expletivization of Voice and derived reflexive unaccusativity.',\n",

Three factors were manipulated: type of possessive pronoun (overt vs. null), syntactic configuration regulating the intra-sentential relation between the pronoun and its antecedent (locality and c-command), the interpretation assigned to the pronoun (anaphoric, non-anaphoric and exophoric). The results suggests that the hypothesis is correct, although a significant difference among BP and Finnish was found, showing that Finns has less acceptance of non-anaphoric readings for null pronouns. As for overt pronouns, the picture is more complex, showing differences between languages and conditions.

Both analyses attribute the factive island effect to a pathology of meaning, but they take different views regarding the semantic and pragmatic ingredients of this pathology. On Oshima’s analysis, the perceived ungrammaticality in factive islands is due to a conflict between two felicity conditions on wh-questions. In contrast, without postulating felicity conditions particular to questions, Abrusán credits factive islands to universally projected contradictory presuppositions. After reformulating and fleshing out the two analyses in order to facilitate comparison, we argue that Oshima’s analysis is supported by independent evidence while Abrusán’s is not. This result informs the ongoing debate regarding the proper notion of meaning triviality that induces judgments of ungrammaticality (Gajewski 2009, Abrusán 2014, Del Pinal 2017). It suggests that in order to properly apply to wh-questions, a comprehensive theory of this notion must make reference to felicity conditions on questions, and that meaning-based ungrammaticality cannot uniformly be attributed to the triviality of propositional content.',\n",

Some V1 languages are strictly VSO, others are VOS, and a significant number combine both orders. This chapter focuses on data from VSO/VOS languages and the factors that underlie these alternations. A number of V1 languages can be more adequately characterized as predicate-initial, with V1 being just a subset of clause-initial predicates.  The chapter presents a number of structural properties that are or may be associated with V1 and discusses possible implicational relations between such properties and V1. While there are certain common characteristics observed across V1 languages, it is also clear that there are several distinct subtypes of V1. These subtypes call for different syntactic analyses; main approaches include the derivation of V1 via phrasal movement (VP-raising) and its derivation via head-movement (verb-raising). Other syntactic approaches to the derivation of V1 include the parametrization of specifier direction within a single language, non-configurational syntax, and subject lowering. In addition to these purely syntactic analyses, several recent approaches place the derivation of V1 outside syntax or at the syntax-PF interface. Careful, in-depth analyses of individual languages are required to test the different approaches to V1; in quite a few cases such analyses are still lacking.',\n",

In nominative and accusative contexts, the second noun (N2) is marked with partitive case while the first noun/numeral (N1) is marked with the case of the pseudopartitive. In all other case contexts both nouns must bear the case of the pseudopartitive. I propose that the partitive case on N2 is an unmarked case in the sense of Baker (2015) and Marantz (1991), among others. It is assigned to complements of nouns that do not already have a case value. This derives the case-marking alternation as a matter of timing: nominative and accusative are assigned too late to affect case-marking internal to the pseudopartitive. I show that pseudopartitives are not amenable to an analysis in terms of case-stacking as has been proposed for similar phenomena. The analysis presented here also extends to collocations of numerals and pseudopartitives in Estonian. I also show how the analysis can be extended to account for differences between Finnish and Estonian, and I suggest a typology of pseudopartitive-marking predicted by the analysis I propose. The analysis has implications for case realization and assignment as well as pseudopartitive and DP structure.',\n",

Dayal (2004) demonstrates that the interpretation of bare nouns with respect to definiteness is significantly constrained in Hindi and Russian. In these languages, singular and plural bare nouns present different possibilities for indefinite interpretation, in a way that receives a natural explanation within a neo-Carlsonian theory of noun meaning (Chierchia 1998). This makes for a close connection between the meanings of bare nouns in English and those in Hindi and Russian. Does this connection extend to the meanings of bare nouns in number-marking languages in general, even outside of Indo-European? In this paper, we demonstrate that the answer is yes. Our evidence comes from bare noun interpretation in Teotitlán del Valle Zapotec, a language of Oaxaca, Mexico. The Zapotec findings closely replicate Dayal's findings for Indo-European languages, providing support for the viability of the neo-Carlsonian approach as a set of constraints on semantic variation in general.\",\n",

To illustrate this, I will inves- tigate the interaction between Case alignment and instrumental voice constructions (hereafter IVCs) in Ixil (Mayan) (Dayley 1981; Ayres 1983, 1991). In particular, I will address the unexpected emergence of the ergative in a subcase of IVCs: unergatives and unaccusatives. This occurs when an instrumental phrase is fronted to clause-initial position. I will claim that the fronted instrumental phrase feeds the assignment of ergative Case, adopting a recent phase-based analysis of dependent ergative case (Baker 2014, 2015). As will be shown, the ergative found in unac- cusatives and unergatives as well as the regular ergative of Ixil can be analyzed as dependent ergative under this analysis.',\n",

We provide a unified analysis for epistemic and predictive readings as epistemic necessity, and the shift between the two is determined compositionally by the lower tense. Our account thus acknowledges a systematic interaction between modality and tense— but the future itself is a pure modal, not a mixed temporal/modal operator. We show that the modal base of the future is nonveridical, i.e. it includes p and ¬p worlds, parallel to epistemic modals such as MUST, and present arguments that future morphemes are a category that stands in between epistemic modals and predicates of personal taste.

The proposed deduction of the ban in question leaves room for movement out of moved elements to take place in one well-defined context, which is shown to be borne out.

They are categorially verbal at all levels of the syntax, including having structural subjects rather than possessor specifiers. Their nominal behavior is entirely due to the unvalued Case feature borne by their Infl head, which they share with all participial verb forms. I then argue that agent nominalizations are categorially nominal at all levels of the syntax, and that the verb-like case assignment of transitive agent nominalizations is due to the verbal Aspect feature borne by their nominalizing head.

       "  'Haspelmath (2006) argues that the concept of markedness is confused and problematic. He urges linguists to dispense with the term. One principle criticism is that markedness solutions seem always to require further explanation rather than actually providing answers (Samuels 2011). Concordantly, Hale & Reiss (2000, 2008), pioneers of Substance Free Phonology (SFP) argue that markedness has no place in what should be a formal theory of linguistic competence, thereby excluding phonetics and diachrony. Accepting the significant merit of these strains of thought (and many of their conclusions), this paper shows that there is nonetheless space for a theory of markedness in formal phonology. By examining markedness from a highly representational viewpoint, I will show that ‘markedness as complexity’ does have an explanatory role, at least for syllable structure. I will demonstrate that markedness is explicable in terms of ‘structural complexity’ and ‘length of description’. The core demonstration will be Charette’s (1990, 1991, 1992) typology and analysis of consonant clusters (CCs). Her papers discovered important implicational universals she related these directly to representations. As well as enriching the typology, my contribution will be to arrange the principles and parameters into a decision tree that derives the implicational universals. I will demonstrate that the number of parameter settings (the depth in the decision tree) increases the markedness of the resultant grammar (cf. Ulfsbjorninn 2014). Each parametric ‘yes’ setting corresponds to an extra empty phonological category or extra ability to license in the representation. For this reason, markedness is not merely a ‘metaphor’ ‘for a cognitive state’ (Haspelmath 2006), it is directly convertible into linguistic categories. This markedness is still ‘extra-grammatical’; it is not part of the computation of forms (contra Optimality Theory) and markedness statements cannot be re-ranked to obtain different grammars. However, markedness is one step in the chain of explanation for: (a) the apparent step-wise variation of complexity and implicational universals of consonant clusters. (b) the Trubetzkoy hypothesis. I will defend markedness in the same terms as Gurevich (2001) criticises it: ‘[as a] an encoding of a universal ‘naturalness’ in the phonology’. Crucially, this naturalness is a product internal to the phonology (adjacency, licensing, parameter settings) and not grounded in phonetics. ',\n",

The major theoretical claim of this study is the following. IC, being the [+realis] morpheme in Arapaho, appears in a high functional projection in the clause, namely C; it is analyzed as the spell-out of C[+realis]. As such, it competes for this position with a number of morphemes belonging to the CP domain in the language. I will argue that the competition for the C head is driven by the structural properties of the verbal morphology rather than by specific features expressed by the competing morphemes. More specifically, I will suggest that Arapaho is a simple CP language, meaning that only one C head can be present in a clause at a time.',\n",

       "  'Devoicing of high vowels (HVD) in Tokyo Japanese applies in two environments—between voiceless consonants, and between a voiceless consonant and a “pause”—and applies variably as a function of a number of factors. The role and definition of “pause” in this process, in terms of a physical pause or prosodic position (word or phrase boundary), remains unclear, as does what is expected when these environments overlap, and why HVD appears to be categorical in some environments and variable in others. This paper addresses three outstanding issues about HVD—the role of “boundary phenomena” (prosodic position and physical pauses), the relationship between the two environments, and the sources of variability in HVD—by examining vowel devoicing in a large corpus of spontaneous Japanese. We use mixed-effects logistic regression to model how boundary phenomena affect the likelihood of devoicing and modulate the effects of other variables, controlling for other major factors, including a measure of gestural overlap. The results suggest that all boundary phenomena jointly affect devoicing rate, and that prosodic phrase boundaries play a key role: variability in HVD looks qualitatively different for phrase-internal and phrase-final vowels, which are affected differently by word frequency, speech rate, and pause duration. We argue the results support an account of HVD as the result of two overlapping vowel devoicing processes, each widely-attested cross-linguistically: devoicing between voiceless consonants, and devoicing before prosodic phrase boundaries. Variability in the application of these two processes can then be partially explained in terms of aspects of phonetic implementation and processing: gestural overlap (Beckman, 1996), which often plays a role in reduction processes, and the locality of production planning (Wagner, 2012), a recent explanation for variability in the application of external sandhi processes.',\n",

One possible explanation for this difference is that non-standardization blurs the boundaries of grammatical variants and increases grammatical fluidity. Affected by such factors, bilectals become less accurate in identifying the variety to which a grammatical variant pertains. Another explanation is that their differential performance derives from the fact that they are competent in two varieties. Under this scenario, the difference is due to the existence of two linguistic systems in the course of development, and not to how close or standardized these systems are. This study employs a novel variety-judgment task in order to elucidate which of the two explanations holds. Having administered the task to monolinguals, bilectals, and bilinguals, including heritage language learners and L1 attriters, we obtained a dataset of 16,245 sentences. The analysis shows differential performance between bilectal and bilingual speakers, granting support for the first explanation.

Thus, a story on which a particular syntactic feature—such as tense—cues the learner to the appropriate label for a particular semantic distinction—belief v. desire—will not work unmodified. Our proposal in this chapter is that, rather than being cued to a semantic distinction, like belief v. desire, by a particular syntactic feature, like subordinate clause tense, learners may utilize more abstract syntactic cues, whose instantiation is constrained to a small set of possible syntactic feature configurations, but must ultimately be tuned to the syntactic distinctions present in a particular language.',\n",

For example, (i) fewer than 4 boys smiled, where the predicate is distributive, has no existential entailment, but an upper-bound reading; while (ii) fewer than 4 boys lifted the piano together, where the predicate is collective, has an existential entailment, but no upper-bound reading. Following Brasoveanu (2013)’s post-supposition-style account for modified numerals, here I propose that (I) the semantic contribution of non-increasing modified numerals is twofold: (i) introducing a maximal referent as at-issue meaning in the derivation, and (ii) adding a cardinality constraint as a secondary dimension of meaning, and (II) that it is the type of predicates (distributive vs. collective) that determines the scope of maximization and where to evaluate this secondary dimension of meaning – at the sentential level or within a group-denoting DP.',\n",

Diachronic studies have reported increasing use of the 1-2 order starting as early as the 15th century. As diachronic change typically leads to synchronic variation, we hypothesize that the synchronic order variation can be related to this diachronic development. On the basis of an apparent-time study of spontaneous spoken language data from the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands, we show that younger speakers indeed use the 1-2 order more frequently.',\n",

I argue, contra Chomsky (ibid.), that a category raised into the Criterial Position should not be able to move up further in the derivational system of Labeling Algorithm. In Scandinavian Object Shift (Holmberg 1986), the object pronoun can exceptionally move out of the Spec of R, which is the Criterial Position for objects in the unmarked case in which they complete the valuation of their unvalued Case feature. In Icelandic Stylistic Fronting (Holmberg 2000), the categories that do not have any feature(s) in which they should agree with T can exceptionally move to the Spec of T, which is a typical Criterial Position claimed in the literature (Rizzi 2015). On the basis of the literature (Hosono 2013, Holmberg 2000), I propose that these kinds of exceptional syntactic movement from/into the Criterial Position in which a raised category does not have any unvalued feature(s) (in which it should agree with a head in a raised position) can occur only when it is required from phonology. I also suggest that a sentential element without any unvalued feature(s) can merge (either externally or internally) to a lower position/Spec of a head the projection of which has already been labeled: when a higher syntactic object is already labeled, a syntactic object inside it does not need a new label, with a sentential element merged (either externally or internally) to a lower position/Spec unnecessary to agree with any head.',\n",

Affixes that are roots show ‘flexible’ categorial behavior, are subject to ‘lexical’ phonological rules, and may trigger idiosyncratic meanings.

I explore two generalizations of the basic theory: one is oriented around assignment-relative sets of alternatives, and the other incorporates a dynamic perspective on assignment functions.

In this work, the relative amount of information one stroke conveys in Korean Hangul and Japanese Katakana is analyzed and compared extensively with 1676 most frequently used vocabulary pairs. Korean Hangul and Japanese Katakana have good characteristics to be the research subjects. First, they are almost entirely made with clearly distinguishable strokes which make it easy to count their numbers. Circles in Hangul and Katakana, the only mini-graphemes which are not a stroke, can be considered as one stroke without loss of generality. Second, it is easy to find one-to-one mappings of Korean and Japanese words. Because words of similar meanings but with different nuances can make the analysis result of this work less precise, it is important to select two target languages like Korean and Japanese which can be translated into each other with much of their subtle meanings kept intact. The analysis has shown that one stroke in Hangul is 21.20% less informative than its counterpart in Katakana: on average 0.7880 (which is 1 - 21.20%) Katakana strokes are needed to express the meaning conveyed in 1 Hangul stroke. In detail, the average ratio of the number of strokes of Katakana to Hangul for each word pair is 0.7880 and the standard deviation is 0.3538. This research is by far the first research which addressed the amount of information conveyed by strokes of writing systems. It will be easy to broaden the research to many other writing systems such as both traditional and simplified Chinese characters, Japanese Hiragana and Latin and Greek alphabets.',\n",

       "  \"Concentrating on the taxonomy of grammatical morphemes, this study shows that traditional definitions of inflectional vs. derivational morphemes do not pass more rigorous testing, although they probably reflect instinctive distinctions present in a natural language system. The authors propose to define the distinctions by referring to derivational stages, namely by distinguishing levels of insertion for morphemes. Most of what is usually classified as derivational morphology and subject to Williams’s (1981) Right Hand Head Rule are morphemes which enter derivations in narrow syntax. As such, they conform to what is here termed a Logical Form Interpretation Condition, which allows only one syntactic feature per morpheme. On the other hand, morphemes such as agreements are not subject to the Right Hand Head Rule and result from post-syntactic insertion and exhibit cross-classification. The authors propose that the source of these bound inflections is the process of Alternative Realisation.  They argue that their new distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology correlates with testable semantic, phonetic and syntactic properties and that in terms of these properties, both are necessary parts of an adequate formal linguistic framework. A curious aspect of the conclusions is that W. Humboldt's division in 1820 between morphemes that express several features (inflection) and those which express only one (agglutination) turns out to be the best analysis, with the majority of affixes felt to be 'inflections' by todayS linguists of almost all persuasions (mood, tense, noun plurals, ádjectival comparison, etc.) turn out not to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

In languages such as Washo (Hokan) or Hare (Athapaskan), morphemes that express indirect evidentiality can also be used to express mirativity (DeLancey 2001, Aikhenvald 2004, 2012). In Turkish, the present perfect can express all three semantic interpretations: present perfect (PPA), indirect evidentiality (IE), and mirativity (MIR). The question therefore arises what common element links these three interpretations and the particular pairings observed (PPA-IE, IE-MIR, PPA-IE-MIR). Previous accounts such as Bybee & Dahl (1989) and Izvorski (2007) only account for a single link in the triad: PPA-IE. We propose that a proper account of the relations between PPA, IE, and MIR requires that mirativity be redefined in terms of ‘sudden discovery or realisation’ (Adelaar 1977, 2012, Mexas 2016).). This redefinition allows us to explain the link between PPA, IE, and MIR in terms of the temporal nature of the traditional aspectual classes: states, processes, accomplishments, and achievements (Vendler 1967, Mourelatos 1979). Indirect evidentiality can then be viewed as the evidential counterpart of an accomplishment in the aspectual sense, while the category of mirativity should be viewed as the mirror image of achievements. We will propose a formal semantic analysis that can capture this insight and account for the specific pairings observed.\\r\\n',\n",

Essentially, \"almost\" can hold if the proposition follows from the normal outcomes of adding a small number of premises to a selection of relevant facts.  The counterfactual behaves like an ordinary one in several ways, but differs from it in ways that are predictable from its lexical entry.  The counterfactual\\'s ability to save \"almost\"-at-a-distance is blocked when the temporal properties of the modal anchor and Davidsonian event prevent normal outcomes from coming true when they need to.  Also, non-propositional complements of \"almost\" block \"almost\"-at-a-distance by restricting the same temporal properties and preventing normal outcomes from coming true when they need to. \\r\\n \\r\\n This approach to \"almost\" differs sharply from the two general approaches that have emerged in the literature, by replacing the negative polar condition (not p) with a positive `antecedent condition\\' that entails not p while avoiding the numerous well-documented complications of employing a polar condition.  This approach also highlights the important role played by ordering sources based on normal outcomes in counterfactuality and in weak necessity modals, and suggests that the bridge between the two is the ordering source.',\n",

In the sample we tested, 9 out of 11 languages from 5 different language families allow for asymmetric marking with the two conjuncts differing in case. (ii) We show that these findings deal a fatal blow to many popular (broadly) Minimalist accounts of DOM, namely, those that derive DOM via movement. Since coordination structures are robust islands, it can be shown that, at least in these 9 languages, movement cannot be a necessary condition for DOM.

This conclusion is reached through a detailed comparison of INFL and verbal auxiliaries, revealing striking asymmetries, syntactic and phonological, between the two. The autonomy of INFL is argued to be a reflex of how verbal morphology is organized into complex heads in Bantu languages.

This view has been motivated in part by the observation that the classic GB theory of 'pro' as a minimally specified nominal whose features are supplied by Infl is incompatible with the approach to feature theory developed in the Minimalist Program (Chomsky l995, 2001 and subsequent work). In this framework, the φ-features in T are assumed to be uninterpretable, hence unvalued. This raises a problem for the idea that subject pro is inherently unspecified for φ-features. \\r\\n\\tConcomitantly, recent theories of the nature of pronouns (Elbourne 2005) have posited a phonologically null NP as a complement of D in every pronoun (an NP affected by deletion, in the case of E-type pronouns, or a default, nearly semantically empty nominal [NP e] in the case of regular pronouns). This proposal reintroduces the need to posit a null, minimally specified NP in the grammar, thus reopening the issue of whether 'pro' can be reduced to an instance of [NP e]. Here we offer an analysis of different types of subject pro-drop that attempts to reduce pro to the very same [NP e] that occurs as complement of D in pronouns or is independently attested in cases of null NP anaphora (in the spirit of Tomioka 2003).\",\n",

This paper derives analogous faithfulness conditions for HG idempotency and output-drivenness and develops an intuitive interpretation of the various OT and HG faithfulness conditions thus obtained. The intuition is that faithfulness constraints measure the phonological distance between underlying and output forms. They should thus comply with a crucial axiom of the definition of distance, namely that any side of a triangle is shorter than the sum of the other two sides. This intuition leads to a faithfulness triangle inequality which is shown to be equivalent to the faithfulness conditions for idempotency and output-drivenness.

I explore the projection patterns under CF for standard presupposition triggers and co-speech gestures and conclude that the two pattern closely together. I show that non-projection under CF can be caused locally, when the assertive content of the focused elements of the CF alternatives is not contrastable enough, so CF has to associate with the presuppositional content, for which the latter needs to be accommodated. Non-projection can also be caused globally, when the presupposition of one of the CF alternatives contradicts the presupposition or assertion of some other alternative, which I derive via the alternative assertability principle. I also look at supplements, namely, non-restrictive relative clauses, which interact with CF differently from standard presuppositions and inferences triggered by co-speech gestures. The observed differences are mostly attributable to the configurational properties of the different types of non-at-issue content, so it is unclear to what extent the data investigated in this paper could be used to independently argue for the presuppositional analysis of co-speech gestures and against the supplemental one.',\n",

Further, we argue that tense/mood suffixes are associated with different cophonologies (Inkelas & Zoll 2007) depending on which stem syllable they assign accent to and whether they enforce iterative iambs or trochees. Finally, in Ese’eja when accent is assigned outside the window, the position of primary prominence falls on a position which is rhythmically dependent on the window-external accent, e.g. uniformly two syllables away, termed ‘Rhythmic Repair’. We contrast this novel type to ‘Default Repair’, where primary prominence is realized on a default position when accent appears outside of the metrical window (Kager 2012).',\n",

However, there are other phonological processes in Czech (infinitival lengthening), which suggest that the root and the theme marker form a constituent to the exclusion of the prefix: [pref [root theme]]. We argue that the apparent contradiction is resolved by prefix movement (Svenonius 2004). The prefix and the root are merged together, and there is a cycle of phonological computation that determines the vowel/zero status of the alternation site in the prefix. After the first cycle, the theme marker is added and the prefix moves higher up in the structure. This creates a remnant constituent containing just the root and the theme marker, and it is this remnant constituent that is subject to the infinitival lengthening.',\n",

These methods have started to clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any, do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the 'lexical meaning' of individual calls? (iii) how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve?  Four case studies from this emerging field of 'primate linguistics' provide initial answers, pertaining to Old World monkeys (Putty-nosed monkeys, Campbell's monkeys and Colobus monkeys) and New World monkeys (black-fronted Titi monkeys). The morphology mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell's -oo) one finds a root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call concatenation can be analyzed as being semantically conjunctive. But a key question concerns the division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context ('world' knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation in the semantics (Campbell's krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack sequences) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of 'urgency'. Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in complex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context. With respect to call evolution, the remarkable preservation of call form and function over millions of years should make it possible to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, illustrated with cercopithecine booms. \",\n",

       "  'Modern generative linguistic theory furnishes a variety of general principles that appear to be at work in the grammar of all the world’s languages. One of the most basic and uncontroversial of these principles is that Agree/Move operates according to the principle of attract closest, whereby the closest suitable goal must be the target for the relevant operation (Rizzi 1990; Chomsky 1995, 2000; Richards 1998). As first pointed out by Seiter (1980), the operation of raising in the Polynesian language Niuean (Tongic subgroup) raises suspicions as to whether this principle is truly at work in all languages. Niuean raising, despite patterning under all relevant diagnostics as A-movement, may felicitously target objects in the presence of subjects that are themselves optionally accessible to the operation. Niuean lacks any form of scrambling and is rigidly VSO, so that at first glance, that attract closest is not at work. In this paper, we argue that Niuean’s challenge to universal principles is only apparent, and that the traditional attract closest condition is indeed in force in Niuean. First, we show that the availability of object-to-subject raising reflects a wider subject/object parity whereby subjects and objects appear to be equally accessible to higher probes in general. Then, we argue that this typologically uncommon equal-accessibility follows from the convergence of several oth- erwise independently attested operations: (i) object shift of case-bearing DPs to Spec(vP); (ii) an ergative case system, with case assignment achieved wholly within vP; (iii) an EPP on T triggering V/VP fronting, not DP externalization. The result is that Niuean raising adheres to standard locality constraints as conceived by Chomsky (1995, 2000).',\n",

       "  'The contentious question in the tough-construction literature is whether the surface subject originates in the embedded clause and moves to the matrix subject position (the long-movement analysis) or whether the surface subject is base-generated in the matrix clause and a proxy link is established with the embedded gap, typically via a null operator (the base-generation analysis). In this paper, we subject to closer scrutiny one particularly influential recent argument in favour of the long-movement analysis. Hartman (2011, 2012a,b) discovered that experiencer PPs lead to ungrammaticality in tough-constructions, but not in expletive constructions. He attributes this ungrammaticality to defective intervention of A-movement, a movement step crucially postulated only in the long-movement analysis. He takes this as evidence that tough-constructions are derived via long movement. We make the novel observation that a PP intervention effect analogous to that in tough-constructions also arises in constructions that do not involve A-movement, namely pretty-predicate constructions and gapped degree phrases. Consequently, the intervention effect does not provide an argument for an A-movement step in tough-constructions or for the long-movement analysis, but rather for the base-generation analysis. We develop a uniform account of the intervention effects as a semantic-type mismatch. In particular, we propose that what unifies tough-constructions, pretty-predicate constructions, and gapped degree phrases is that they all have an embedded clause that is a null-operator structure. Introducing an experiencer PP into these constructions creates an irresolvable semantic-type mismatch. As such, we argue for a reassessment of what appears to be a syntactic locality constraint as an incompatibility in the semantic composition.',\n",

I show that this type is not “contrastive” in the sense of involving a closed set of contextually identifiable alternatives, as has been claimed in previous studies, and does not necessarily have a corrective import. The conditions this type is subject to are: (i) the fronted constituent is a true focus (in the sense of an element introducing alternatives in the interpretation, see Rooth 1992, Krifka 2008) and not just new information; (ii) an exhaustivity presupposition or implicature (described as rejection of all other alternatives) and an existential presupposition (one alternative is true) are introduced, in a way similar to English it-clefts, as discussed by Büring and Križ (2013). I further present some differences with respect to English clefts. Finally, I discuss the status of the negation that precedes a fronted focus, arguing for a sentential negation analysis.',\n",

Proclitic placement increases in frequency throughout the late Middle Ages but then declines, disappearing altogether in the early modern period. The present article reports the results of a detailed quantitative survey which tracks this diachronic event for approximately 350 years at the decadal level. The findings reveal with some precision the quantitative curve described by this failed change and enable a number of hypotheses to be constructed in relation to the event’s nature, as well as its place within developments in the infinitival subsystem overall. In addition, the case study presented here suggests that failed changes are not necessarily capable of being modelled as a single Hubbert curve, as Postma proposes.

Offering original comparative data from a range of predominantly European varieties standard and non-standard, we argue that the distinct interpretation and behaviour of each of the three types of illocutionary complementiser examined necessitates a revision and expansion of the clausal left-edge to incorporate utterance-oriented information within a dedicated domain above the CP.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2 argues that Ibero-Romance vocatives and discourse particles exhibit syntactic behaviour which cannot be accounted for within a clausal architecture whose topmost layer is the CP. Instead, these utterance-oriented items’ behaviour and sentential distribution is indicative of an internally-articulated dedicated utterance field, which we call the Utterance Phrase (UP), above the CP, divisible into a higher, externally-oriented layer and a lower, internally-oriented layer (itself decomposable into dedicated projections for addressee and speaker). The remainder of the dissertation describes and analyses three types of illocutionary complementiser attested in Ibero-Romance, and shows that each item differs from the others not only in interpretation, but also in terms of their formal and distributional properties, and availability across Ibero-Romance dialects. Only one of these complementisers (quotative que, Chapter 4) patterns like a C-head; the other two (exclamative and conjunctive que, in Chapters 3 and 5 respectively) show distinct behaviour which we argue is evidence that they lexicalise separate U-heads within an expanded and revised cartographic left-periphery. The bundling of features on functional heads at the UP/CP boundary —the locus of the split Rizzian ForceP, or Speas & Tenny’s (2003) SentienceP— is unique to European Portuguese, contrasting with feature-scattering (following Giorgi & Pianesi 1997) across projections in other Peninsular Ibero-Romance varieties. This variation in feature distribution is argued to be responsible for microparametric differences in the availability and behaviour of illocutionary complementisers across Ibero-Romance. The compositionality of sentence-typing; fine-grained differences in the specification of complementisers; and gradient judgments on the constructions in which the illocutionary complementisers participate are also accounted for in these terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dissertation proposes that, despite the progressive obsolescence of such items in standard, contemporary European Portuguese, the ubiquity of matrix illocutionary complementisers in European/Peninsular Ibero-Romance is a defining characteristic of this branch of the Romance languages. On the view that their loss in European Portuguese is counterbalanced by verb-based mechanisms for sentence- and illocutionary-typing, Chapter 6 concludes by exploring the possibility that the prevalence of illocutionary complementisers, and other utterance-oriented elements, correlates inversely with verb height.',\n",

       "  'This paper investigates TP-ellipsis with a polarity particle in Spanish, with particular attention to its occurrence in multiple-complementizer clauses (i.e., … que XP que ellipsis licensor ellipsis site). The paper argues for a version of the standard ΣP-account of TP-ellipsis, with the polarity/focal item (e.g., también/tampoco/sí/no) crucially involved in the licensing of ellipsis. It is argued that the XP-que sequence is hosted in TopicP. The XP is a contrastive topic functioning as the remnant of TP-ellipsis and que instantiates recomplementation que –a topic marker. The ellipsis licensor, for its part, sits in a CP-related projection that follows TopicP. In light of the parallelism drawn here between the polarity elements that can partake in the licensing of TP-ellipsis and run-of-the-mill foci, the paper provides a host of arguments from Spanish and related languages underscoring the role of focus in this type of ellipsis operation, which may ultimately lead to the conflation of ΣP and FocusP. Similarly, I explore the relationship established between TopicP (the remnant) and ΣP/FocusP (the ellipsis licensor) in the process of TP-ellipsis as well as offer a principled account of the inability of jussive/optative que to survive ellipsis, unlike recomplementation que. The results of this paper therefore have wide-ranging consequences for the derivation of TP-ellipsis phenomena alongside the delineation of the preverbal field in Spanish and beyond.',\n",

It argues that the nunation suffix, -n, is used to fill the position of the head in a determiner phrase (i.e. the head Dº position) when the latter is not occupied by the definite article or a personal pronoun. The filling follows from a proposed condition that demands the head Dº position to be filled by an overt element in the Arabic dialect under\\r\\ninvestigation. This accounts for the lack of -n with definite entities (i.e. definite determiner phrases, DPs) headed by the definite article ʔal, on the one hand, and the presence of -n in indefinite entities and proper nouns, on the other. Additionally, to account for the use of -n with adverbs, the current study assumes that adverbs in HA are underlyingly DPs headed by Dº; hence, the demand to fill Dº due to the head Dº condition. With regard to the semantic function of -n, the study argues that the nunation\\r\\nsuffix creates a predicational relation between the noun and the remnant of the DP through forcing the given noun to move to the Specifier position of the associating DP. What forces this movement is the [EDGE] feature, which is part of the featural bundle of the nunation suffix, requiring the edge of a phrase to be filled',\n",

It also examines the Propositional Cleft.  While the Propositional Cleft is acknowledged in Scottish Gaelic grammars, a thorough description and analysis has not been done.  The Propositional Cleft is noteworthy for the presence of cleft morphosyntax--the copula, a pro-form, and the relative complementizer--but the absence of a clefted constituent.  This lack of a clefted constituent is puzzling if the Propositional Cleft is to be included in the cleft paradigm, since it is the clefted constituent which is typically interpreted as the focus, and the interpretation of focus is typically assumed to be derived from the focus-background bipartite structure created by the cleft construction.  This property of lacking a bipartite structure makes the Propositional Cleft, at first glance, an unlikely candidate for membership in the cleft paradigm.  Over the course of the dissertation I describe and analyze the pragmatic effect of the Propositional Cleft, and I argue that the Propositional Cleft is in fact a member of the cleft paradigm, but that it instantiates a typologically rare combination of broad sized identificational focus.  The syntactic and semantic analysis of clefts proposed here extends straightforwardly to derive the particular meaning and structure of the Propositional Cleft, and shows that broad focus is not incompatible with cleft meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI argue that A-bar dependencies in Scottish Gaelic are movement-based, and propose a syntactic account of focus movement in clefts which involves the checking of focus features in C by the movement of the focus phrase to its specifier.  This syntactic account of focus allows us to understand the absence of movement in the Propositional Cleft, since the broad size of focus means that  the focus constituent is the complement of CP, and so can check the focus features of C in situ.',\n",

Both realizations display restrictions on subject selection: in embedded contexts, the subject of a directive clause cannot be co-referential with the matrix context. This restriction, known as subject obviation, has been previously discussed mostly in relation to subjunctive embedding, and not observed with imperatives. A similar restriction arises with all directive clauses also in matrix contexts, namely: the subject of a matrix directive clause cannot be first person exclusive. I argue that both restrictions are manifestations of the same phenomenon, a generalized subject obviation. I propose that the restriction arises due to a binding restriction which applies between the subject of directive clauses and a perspectival PRO in the specifier of MoodP. I suggest that this PRO is required for the interpretation of a directive operator in Mood and serves as a grammatical representation for the source of the directive speech act realized by directive clauses. As such it is semantically bound by either an expression referring to the speaker, in matrix clauses, or the matrix subject in embedded clauses. The latter is a parallel to subject control constructions. I show that this analysis not only derives the generalized subject obviation effect, but that it also correctly predicts other restrictions that occur with directive clauses, such as the absence of the exclusive first person subject ban in questions. The ban is correctly predicted to apply to second person subjects in questions instead, which explains the cross-linguistic absence of imperatives in matrix questions.',\n",

In Scandinavian Object Shift, the object pronoun can exceptionally move out of [Spec,RP], the Criterial Position for objects in the unmarked case in which they complete the valuation of their unvalued Case feature. In Icelandic Stylistic Fronting, the categories that do not have any feature(s) in which they should agree with T can exceptionally move to [Spec,TP], a typical Criterial Position claimed in the literature (Rizzi 2015). Hosono (2013) argues that the object pronoun in the Scandinavian languages moves to cause downstep. Holmberg (2000) argues that Icelandic Stylistic Fronting occurs due to the requirement that something phonologically visible must occupy [Spec,TP]. On the basis of their claims, I propose that exceptional movement from/into the Criterial Position can occur only when it is required from phonology. It is argued that though a raised category must have some unvalued feature(s) in which it should agree with a head in a raised position in the system of Labeling Algorithm, a category can move without any unvalued feature(s) in this exceptional syntactic movement.',\n",

Traditionally, the effect of weight in Portuguese is seen as categorical, and only word-final syllables are considered to be weight-sensitive—i.e., the weight of penult and antepenult syllables is not relevant for stress. I examine stress placement across a comprehensive lexicon of Portuguese non-verbs (Houaiss et al. 2001), and show that weight effects (i) are also present word-internally and (ii) gradually weaken as we move away from the right edge of the word—this gradience is supported by different Ordinal Regression models. I compare two theories of weight domain, namely, the syllable and the interval (Steriade 2012)— defined as a rhythmic unit that spans from one vowel up to (but not including) the next vowel. Under both theories, weight has a gradient effect on stress, and is not limited to the right edge of the word. The data analysed suggest that intervals may be more accurate representations of the weight domain in Portuguese, in that they appropriately capture onset effects found in the lexicon that are not accounted for under syllable theory. In addition, interval-based models are more accurate than syllable-based models. Finally, I briefly demonstrate how the analysis proposed here can be mapped into a MaxEnt model (Goldwater & Johnson 2003, Wilson 2006, Hayes & Wilson 2008).',\n",

Main evidence for this argument comes from the interaction between syntactic head movement and postsyntactic affixation in the Niger-Congo language Wolof, which confirms an important prediction of this analysis. Namely, if a postsyntactic process can feed a syntactic one, we also expect the postsyntactic process to be bled if the structural conditions for its application are not met, resulting in surface opacity effects. This is precisely what we find in Wolof, where the past tense morpheme 'oon' is postsyntactically affixed onto the verb in a particular structural con- figuration and carried along with it to C, but stranded by the verb below C if the structural requirements for its affixation are not met.\",\n",

The first uses higher-order dynamic generalized quantifiers (GQs), functions whose ‘trace’ is itself typed as a dynamic GQ. Such functions, though a hop-and-a-skip up the type hierarchy from dynamic GQs, are already available to any standard-issue Montagovian dynamic semanticist, and dealing with them compositionally requires nothing beyond whatever machinery already underwrites quantifiers in object position, scope ambiguity, and so on (though the analysis is presented using a handy continuations-oriented tower notation). I build on this theory by exploring a type-theoretic elaboration of it (technically, in terms of subtype polymorphism) that rules out arguably unattested ‘pseudo-cumulative’ readings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, I show that these steps (higher-order dynamic GQs subtyping) are unnecessary if the usual ‘point-wise’ dynamic semantics of Dynamic Predicate Logic or Compositional DRT, where propositions are typed as relations on assignments, is replaced with an update semantics, where propositions are typed as functions from sets of assignments into sets of assignments. Conservative update-semantic meanings for modified numerals — direct analogs of their point-wise counterparts — automatically yield cumulative readings and fail to derive pseudo-cumulative readings. This gives an argument for an update semantics in the anaphoric domain (so far as I know the first of its kind).\\r\\n\\r\\nI compare these two kinds of analyses with each other and consider their relation to post-suppositions in semantic theory more generally, concluding: (i) the theories canvassed here have modest empirical advantages over post-suppositions; (ii) the update-theoretic account offers the most direct route to an empirically adequate analysis of modified numerals; (iii) the reasons for this turn out to be specific to modified numerals; theories of other ‘post-suppositional’ phenomena are better formulated with higher-order GQs.',\n",

By contrast, when attached to an argument, \"nanak\" has a much restricted distribution, and its reading is distinctively reflexive. Interestingly, there is also a grey area in-between the two construals, where \"nanak\" occupies an adjunct position, though interpreted with a variety of reflexive readings. Our inquiry is thus two-fold: The first part is to deal with the issue whether there is a conceptual connection between only and self, especially in view of a strong resemblance from Chinese \"ziji\" ‘self’, which behaves much like an intensifier before negation, while serving as a reflexive adverbial after negation. The second part is to find an interpretive procedure which aims to capture the generalization behind various construals of \"nanak\" and \"ziji\". In this paper, we propose to build upon Horn’s (1969) classic analysis of \"only\", and characterize reflexive adverbials as focus operators involving negation over an alternative set. Depending on the locus of the self-operator, it may be related to either a predicate or a peripheral argument role (cause, instrument, comitant, etc). This explains away the spectrum of ‘selfhood’ readings across Squliq Atayal and Mandarin Chinese, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of how contrastivity interacts with reflexivity in natural languages.',\n",

From this perspective, the paper gives accounts of a number of properties of V-2, like the root/embedded clause asymmetry regarding the productivity of V-2, the non-pickiness of the V-2 requirement (where just about anything can satisfy it), and the role of the freedom of word order in the development of syntactic V-2, where all these are ultimately traced to the presence of a prosodic requirement.

This operation can be analyzed as an overt instantiation of the 'monstrous' mechanism of 'context shift' postulated for attitude reports in some spoken languages (Schlenker 2003, Anand and Nevins 2004, Anand 2006, Quer 2005). For Attitude Role Shift, we argue that this analysis brings new light to the typology of context-shifting operations: while some sign languages make it possible to 'mix perspectives' under Role Shift (Quer 2005), we argue that ASL and LSF obey the constraint that indexicals should 'shift together' (Anand 2006). Still, in ASL and LSF, data from Attitude Role Shift alone cannot fully exclude an alternative analysis based on quotation without context shift. By contrast, Action Role Shift, which has no known counterpart in spoken language, is not amenable to a quotational analysis because it is used to describe actions that don't involve any speech- or thought-acts; in that respect, the context-shifting operations we find in sign language are 'super monsters' that can shift the context outside of attitude reports. We develop a context-shifting analysis that applies both to Attitude and to Action Role Shift.

       "  'This paper offers a detailed descriptive study of negation and Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) in Bangla/Bengali (Indo-Aryan; India). The interaction of negation and copulas in Bangla as well as two syntactically different forms of negation are discussed. The paper explores various properties of NPIs such as strength/weakness, strictness/non- strictness, and reveals that Bangla makes very fine-grained distinctions in each category, giving rise to several new categories not previously attested in the literature. Some of these newly coined categories include Superstrong NPIs, Superweak NPIs, Superstrict NPIs, and Strict-Non-Strict NPIs. The paper also discusses the presence of a very rare class of NPIs - the Weak Strict NPIs – in Bangla. This work also describes the interaction of Bangla NPIs with focus particles and deontic modals, and tests the Positive Polarity Item (PPI) status of a deontic modal with universal force. Attempts at characterizing the strength of this PPI modal leads to puzzling results whereby it is concluded that this modal PPI is both a strong and a weak PPI.',\n",

It begins with a case study of the adverb ‘now’ and its interaction with the meaning of tense. The case study motivates an ontological distinction between events, states and times and proposes that ‘now’ seeks a prominent state that holds throughout the time described by the tense. Building on prior research, prominence is shown to be influenced by principles of discourse coherence and two coherence principles, NARRATION and RESULT, are given a formally explicit characterization. The key innovation is a new method for testing the definitional adequacy of NARRATION and RESULT, namely by an abductive argument. This contribution opens a new way of thinking about how eventive and stative descriptions contribute to the perceived narrative progression in a discourse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme of the second part of the monograph is the semantics and pragmatics of tense. A key innovation is that the present and past tenses are treated as scalar alternatives, a view that is motivated by adopting a particular hypothesis concerning stative predication. The proposed analysis accounts for tense in both matrix clauses and in complements of propositional attitudes, where the notorious double access reading arises. This reading is explored as part of a corpus study that provides a glimpse of how tense semantics interacts with Gricean principles and at-issueness. Several cross-linguistic predictions of the analysis are considered, including their consequences for the Sequence of Tense phenomenon and the Upper Limit Constraint. Finally, a hypothesis is provided about how tense meanings compose with temporal adverbs and verb phrases. Two influential analysis of viewpoint aspect are then compared in light of the hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monograph is directed at graduate students and researchers in semantics, pragmatics and philosophy of language. The analysis of narrative discourse that is developed in the monograph synthesizes and builds on prior collaborative research with Corien Bary, Valentine Hacquard, Thomas Roberts, Roger Schwarzschild, Una Stojnić, Károly Varasdi and Aaron White.',\n",

Given that DPs are also claimed to be phases, the question arises of why verbal idioms can straddle the DP- but not the vP-phase boundary. Our solution to this problem is twofold. We show first of all that not all idioms are actually confined to a single phase: whilst idiomatic phrases are restricted to the vP-phase, idiomatically combing expressions are not. Hence, the DP-phase problem is only relevant for idiomatic phrases. Secondly, we propose that in these instances the determiner, which does not contribute referentiality to the object, actually does not project. Without a DP, there is no DP-phase, and it is the vP-phase that determines the upper limit for the idiom.',\n",

       "  \"We investigate how the semantic information that is carried by a word's linguistic contexts is modulated by the kind of nonlinguistic context that word is used in. We focus in particular on verbs. Using a corpus analysis, we first show that the distribution of syntactic structures and lexical items that a verb occurs with is more complex in some contexts (meal contexts) than in others (play contexts). This finding raises the question of whether meal contexts have more semantic information than play contexts. We address this question in a large-scale Human Simulation Paradigm experiment, where we show that the relationship between distributional complexity and semantic information is not direct. Rather, nonlinguistic contexts with less distributional complexity (e.g. play contexts) yield better learning when simulated learners have little information, and nonlinguistic contexts with greater distributional complexity (e.g. meal contexts) yield better learning when those learners have more information. Further, simulated learners are only able to take advantage of the information in the higher-complexity contexts if they have access to both syntactic and lexical information, while in contrast, those learners are able to take advantage of the information in the lower-complexity contexts even if they have access to only syntactic information. This provides evidence that `pure' syntactic bootstrapping is most useful in early coarse-grained verb-learning, while later verb-learning combines syntactic and lexical information to fine-tune verbs' semantic representations.

It demonstrates that every possible relationship between definiteness and interpretation is attested. It also demonstrates that agreement mismatches are found with relative readings and with proportional readings, but different kinds of agreement mismatches in each case. One consistent pattern is that a quantity superlative with adverbial morphology and neuter singular agreement features is used with relative superlatives. On the other hand, quantity superlatives with proportional readings always agree in number. I conclude that quantity superlatives are not structurally analogous to quality superlatives on either relative or proportional readings, but they depart from a plain attributive structure in different ways. On relative readings they can be akin to pseudopartitives (as in a cup of tea), while proportional readings are more closely related to partitives (as in a piece of the cake). More specifically, I suggest that the agreement features of a superlative exhibits depend on the domain from which the target is drawn (the target-domain hypothesis). When the target is a degree, as it is with adverbial superlatives and certain relative superlatives, default neuter singular emerges. Definiteness there is driven by the same process that drives definiteness with adverbial superlatives. With proportional readings, the target argument of the superlative is a subpart or subset of the domain indicated by the substance noun, hence number agreement. Subtle aspects of how the comparison class and the superlative marker are construed determine definiteness for proportional readings.',\n",

Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that more than one structural element can be the source of the valued features, and that the structurally higher element tends to be responsible for the semantically informed value (for instance, √ and n in Kramer 2009, see Pesetsky 2013 and Landau 2016 for related configurational analyses). Yet it is far from clear what it means for features to be valued from the ‘context,’ and why the structural height of functional heads should make a difference with respect to whether or not a syntactic feature is going to be semantically interpreted.\\r\\nThis paper brings into the debate new data from Standard Italian and uses it to argue for a novel treatment of semantically interpretable φ-features, specifically gender. \\r\\nThe paper has two parts. The first part presents an explicit Distributed Morphology model of Italian nominal morpho-syntax. I provide evidence that Italian nouns come in three distinct flavors, with one group being lexically specified for gender from the lexicon, and the other two unspecified. I show that type of gender specification has morpho-syntactic consequences. The first part of the paper provides the necessary groundwork for the main theoretical proposal presented in section 2. Section 2 elaborates on recent insights of phase theory (Chomsky 2001, 2008, 2013, Narita 2011) and insights of the formal semantic literature on the interpretation of gender features on pronouns (Heim 2008, Sudo 2012, among others). The section argues for a novel model of feature valuation in the syntax-semantic interface and explores under what circumstances a syntactic feature may be semantically interpretable. I argue that the morphology interface accesses the narrow syntax representation at two different temporal points of the derivation within a phase: the earlier point – technically, Spell-Out – returns a morphological realization that is faithful to feature values present in narrow syntax, while the later point – technically, Transfer – allows for a narrow syntax representation to be enriched by the CI component. Thus, there is no syntactic distinction between interpretable and uninterpretable features: a syntactic feature appears to be interpretable only if it has been licensed by CI. ',\n",

Most generally, the question whether AORs can be located in grammar as such in rule-based fashion (e.g. Cinque 1994) is still unsettled. In the current paper, we largely argue against this view and claim that several of the core data to be explained are preferences based on norms rather than rules. A pragmatic explanation is offered to account for marked or apparently ungrammatical examples. First, we demarcate AORs in the narrow sense against data based on truth-conditional differences, show the sole hard constraint to be found in a distinction between object- and kind-modification, and introduce several of the factors argued to drive AORs in the literature. A large-scale corpus study on German AAN-phrases shows a hierarchy of relative adjectives preceding absolute ones (in the sense of Kennedy and McNally 2005) to reliably predict preferences, while temporariness and weight do not. We then illustrate that norm-based preferences can be overwritten via discourse linking and implement markedness in out-of-the-blue contexts pragmatically based on the M-principle (see Levinson 2000). Speculating that AORs in the narrow sense have their origins in more general cognitive principles, our findings support approaches that locate the better part of AORs outside the realm of core grammar.

We find evidence for concluding that evaluatives as well as other derivational suffixes can be equated to classifiers (for size, gender, etc.).

The classic approach to numerical interpretation, first articulated by Horn (1972), contends that the basic meaning of | is 'at least three', and that the upper bound it implies arises by way of scalar implicature. More recent approaches argue that the basic meaning of | is 'exactly three', implemented either with a uniqueness condition on existential quantification (Geurts 2006), or with a cardinality operator that limits the size of the individuals being existentially quantified over (Breheny 2008), or with a maximality operator that imposes an upper bound (Kennedy 2015). The goal of this article is to defend a version of the classic account and to argue against the 'exactly' accounts. The case rests on two new sets of arguments. The first set concerns numerical noun phrases that combine with collective predicates, as in |: the classic account makes just the right predictions, as already argued by Koenig (1991), while the 'exactly' accounts overgenerate. The second set pertains to new data involving generically interpreted numerical noun phrases, as in |, which involve quasi-universal quantification over triplets of individuals (Link 1987, 1991). I show that the classic account provides a simple, uniform analysis of the interpretation of numerals across both existential and generic contexts. The 'exactly' accounts are shown to also be able to handle generic cases (by mirroring the classic account), but Kennedy's account overgenerates. The conclusion, taking into account the entirety of the data discussed here, is that the classic, scalar implicature approach to numerals is more empirically adequate than all of the 'exactly'-based approaches.\",\n",

Using theoretical and experimental tools devised to study human non-linguistic, conceptual abilities, we provide evidence for a new perspective: the rules that govern competition in natural language may be better and more deeply understood as rooted in relative | simplicity, and thus are inherited from non-linguistic domains.

We show that the dynamics of a particular class of inflationary processes in language, including Jespersen's cycle, can be modeled as a consequence of signaling under conflicting interests and fit the resulting model to historical corpus data.\",\n",

       "  'Many have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence.',\n",

The fact that in both clause types the two main constituents seem to be able to surface in either order is often taken to be evidence for predicate inversion/raising, the raising of an underlying predicate to the structural subject position (or possibly a higher projection). I here present data from Wolof copular clauses and pseudoclefts that speak in favor of inversion, but only for specificational pseudoclefts.

Therefore, earlier research has backed the assumption that a NEST is by nature the ideal person to teach English. With a purpose to challenge this assumption, the current study, consisting of two phases, aims to explore in the first phase if there is a meaningful difference between Turkish EFL learners’ perceptions of NESTs and NNESTs on their first encounter with them. The second phase explores whether any changes have occurred in students’ preconceptions regarding NESTs within the course of time. The participants are 120 Turkish monolinguals from a private university. Quantitative data was collected through questionnaires consisting of Likert-scale items in both phases.

       "  'This thesis examines the syntactic structures of restrictive relativisation in English. English exhibits a variety of different relative constructions with different syntactic properties. We pursue the hypothesis that these properties are accounted for by the systematic variation in the structural size of English relatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe review the major competing analyses of relative clauses in the literature, with a particular focus on reconstruction effects, ultimately arguing in favour of the Matching Analysis (Chapter 2). The rest of the thesis is dedicated to the ‘size hypothesis’ and its application to finite, infinitival and reduced relatives in English, with cross-linguistic comparisons being made with Italian, Welsh, Malagasy and French where appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe show that there is systematic variation in the structural size of finite and infinitival clausal relatives, i.e. variation in the degree of articulation of their C-domains, and uncover a categorial distinctness effect in the English C-domain (Chapter 3). Differences in structural size combined with anti-locality are argued to provide a novel perspective on subject-object asymmetries in relative clauses and other related phenomena in English, with a close formal similarity between relativisation and topicalisation emerging as an important result (Chapter 4). We describe and analyse a novel construction involving control into infinitival relatives which offers independent yet complementary insights into the structure of the English C-domain (Chapter 5). We argue that systematic size variation also plays a key role in accounting for the properties of reduced relatives, including their restrictions on auxiliaries and participles, the interpretation of the present/progressive participle and the subject restriction, whilst evidence from high adverbs indicates close similarities between the clausal and clause-medial left peripheries (Chapter 6).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thesis thus contributes a range of novel observations, generalisations and analyses with both empirical and theoretical implications for the nature of variation both within and across languages.\\r\\n',\n",

In this paper, a variety of known and novel data points are argued to indicate that both a Neg movement operation as well as an Excluded Middle assumption are necessary to account for the full range data. It’s proposed that the Neg-Raising phenomenon is a purely pragmatic phenomenon and that the Neg movement operation is conditioned by the presence of an Excluded Middle presupposition.

Cross-linguistic research has recently implied the need to reconsider ‘the more interaction, the more acquisition’ model. We are also reminded that structural-linguistic measures, such as vocabulary size and mean length of utterance are only one aspect of a child’s communicative competence, but some other skills related to pragmatics and conversation are required for language competence. The present study investigates the development of conversational and socio-pragmatic strategies in child discourse from a functional perspective. We especially focus on the impact of the parental input, and question the role of child’s mother in the development of a child’s conversational skills with particular regard to the question-answer forming, positive and negative reinforcement, the effects of frequency, and length of conversation. Our research aims to establish the relationship between the challenging communicative environment (lengthy conversations, parent-initiated speech, answers-at-hand, avoidance of motherese, etc.) and the development of a child’s communicative competence. Our participants have been selected from 5 families. The group comprises totally 5 mothers and 5 Turkish-speaking children. We classified the families as conservative, conservative-pragmatic or modern-educated, and the children as younger and older. The data has been collected via open-ended interviews, and has been transcribed and tagged for analysis. We have found various patterns in parental input shaping a child’s discourse, and the results revealed a significant difference between the two target groups’ conversational strategies, which is due to the critical age for discourse strategies. While the mother’s attempt to adapt her discourse resulted in self-confidence and freedom to question in children, as well as encouragement in initiating conversation to the older children, discouragement from asking questions and from discussing with older individuals had the reverse effect on the older children.',\n",

While LD wh-movement was infrequently observed, wh-scope marking predominantly emerged, possibly because it dispenses with Internal Merge of the wh-phrase pied-piping Q across the clausal boundary. On the other hand, the developing group depended more on silent-scope marking, possibly because the wh-expletive might not have been available in their lexicon. Moreover, the advanced group initially displaced the least possible elements containing the wh-phrase when attempting to derive LD wh-movement, while the developing group could not even displace any elements but spelled-out the wh-phrase in situ. Overall, economy conditions in language acquisition turns out to govern the Mongolian-English interlanguage; hence, more economical derivations emerge at the onset as long as they are admissible, not necessarily grammatical.

We conducted a large-scale corpus study in order to discover what these factors have in common. The underlying generalization appears to be processing complexity: a variety of factors that are related to verbal cluster word order, can also be related to the processing complexity of the cluster's context. This implies that one of the word orders might be easier to process --- when processing load is high, speakers will go for the easier option. Therefore, we also discuss which of the two word orders is easier to process. By testing for associations with factors indicating a higher or lower processing complexity of the verb and its context, we find evidence for the hypothesis that the more frequent of the two orders is easier to process.\",\n",

       "  'According to some version of the predicate theory of names, names denote metalinguistic predicates of a certain type, in a way such that the name Perón as it occurs in the sentence Perón died in 1974 denotes a predicate more less paraphrasable as “being called Perón” (Burge 1973, Elbourne 2005, Matushansky 2008 and Fara 2011, among others). The metalinguistic theory of names is claimed as being superior in non-trivial ways to direct reference theories, according to which names contribute an individual without the mediation of descriptions (Kripke 1980). The alleged triumph of predicativism is that by assuming the “being called N” property as basic, both referential and non-referential uses of names can be given a uniform semantic analysis. The referentialist needs instead to resort to homonymy or semantic ambiguity. The goal of this paper is to show that the uniformity argument does not hold and that the adduced linguistic evidence cannot lead to any meta-semantic consideration. Polysemy in the realm of names is exactly what is expected under the assumption that grammatical categories and the associated meanings that they are supposed to encode are not grammatical primitives, but epiphenomena that result from the particular way in which syntax combines functional material and lexical Roots. Before syntax, lexical Roots have no detectable meanings; they only point to a Polysemy Space that it is distinguished by means of syntax. So, under this account, which I call the allosemy view (Marantz 2013), there are no names before syntax, as there are no nouns, verbs or adjectives. Names are thus seen as the result of a particular syntactic configuration whose semantic realization is that of contributing an individual. Metalinguistic uses of names, and other derived uses, are involved in a different syntactic scheme, one that makes a name Root a predicate of a certain type. As I will show, the predicativist predicament is based on a misconception of how lexical Roots are identified in linguistic theory. The uniformity argument vanishes under the umbrella of the allosemy theory. Under closer inspection, the linguistic evidence point, instead, in favor of referentialism, as already argued by Longobardi (1994). Following his and others insights, I will provide new empirical arguments coming from the syntax of Spanish names in favor of the hypothesis that derived uses of names require some sort of syntactic transformation (Chomsky 1965). The semantic effects of derived uses of names would follow from the meaningless character of name Roots and certain particular processes of deferred interpretation (Nunberg 1004, Jeshion 2015).

The proposal extends recent work on iconicity in sign languages by Davidson (2015), whose demonstration-based framework provides a formal foundation for the semantics of ideophones that captures the difference between descriptive meaning and depictive meaning, the kind of meaning ideophones traffic in. After providing a demonstration-based account of the basic ideophone construction in the Mayan language Tseltal, the paper then shows how the demonstration-based account can be used to analyze pluractionality in the ideophone domain. In particular, through case studies on Tseltal and Upper Necaxa Totonanc (Totonacan), I show that there are two previously unrecognized types of ideophonic pluractionality, and that their properties support the demonstration- based account. The first, which I call “demonstration-external pluractionality”, involves a speaker using an ideophone to do a plurality of demonstrations that characterize a plurality of events. The second kind of ideophonic pluractionality, which I call a “demonstration-internal pluractionality”, is much more similar to pluractionality in the verbal domain, and involves special morphology that derives ideophone stems that can only be used to demonstrate plural events. Finally, I use the contrast between these two types of pluractionality in the ideophone domain to clarify the line between the iconic and non-iconic aspects of the semantics of ideophones.',\n",

We train this model on data from a large-scale judgment study assessing the acceptability of 1,000 English clause-taking verbs in 50 distinct syntactic frames, finding that this model infers coherent semantic type signatures.

However, although phasal complements have no theoretical status in the phase theory (only phases do), they are taken to define spell-out units. This paper argues for an approach where phases define spell-out domains, which means that what is sent to spell-out is the phase itself. Several arguments to this effect are presented regarding syntax-phonology interaction (in particular, encliticization in Bulgarian and Arabic, stress assignment in German and English, raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Abruzzese, and tone sandhi in Taiwanese), as well as more theoretical issues such as labeling. The assumption, however, has significant consequences for successive-cyclic movement. If phases are sent to spell-out and what is sent to spell-out is inaccessible to the syntax, successive-cyclic movement cannot target phases. Under the account argued for here, successive-cyclic movement therefore does not proceed via phases (i.e. phasal edges). As a result, the account also eliminates the PIC.\\r\\n',\n",

It is shown that the strong ineffability effects that this type of mismatches produce can be better accounted for by a radical lexical/syntactic identity condition on ellipsis. The theory is formulated in terms of a formal subset identity condition. Such a theory, supplemented with a licensing ingredient that incorporates contextual restrictions for ellipsis sites, provides also a plausible answer to well-known arguments against syntactic identity (e.g., inflectional asymmetries, and tolerable vehicle change effects). Finally, I compare this syntactic approach to ellipsis with the weaker syntactic view recently proposed by Thoms (2015) and show that a syntactic theory of the identity condition that dispenses entirely with any reference to semantic notions seems to be empirically more adequate in the realm of certain particular instances of Bias Vehicle Change.',\n",

This definition provides for a capability to isolate a true island effect while controlling for two complexity factors that potentially interfere in speakers’ evaluation of the relevant sentences: the length of the respective movement dependency and the presence of an island structure itself. We found that 1) Slovenian speakers do judge the wh-island sentences worse than the respective controls, but the observed degradation cannot be attributed to a true island effect; 2) subject extraction out of a wh-island leads to a so called reverse island effect whereby the acceptability is higher than expected even if the above two complexity factors are taken into consideration; and 3) speakers are sensitive to the subject island effect, as predicted by the mainstream theories of syntactic locality. The results of our study contribute to establishing a solid empirical base for further theoretical investigations of the island effects, and raise new questions about the role of processing factors in speakers’ evaluation of island constructions.',\n",

These features are valued by the element that expresses the contrastive topic of the clause, which, as a result of maintaining an Agree relation with tara, it bears a contrastive stress. Evidence for this assumption comes from the fact that where the entity expressing contrastive topic is a DP, a clitic with the φ-features of this DP is spelled out on tara. The significant point the study advocates is that such valuation occurs while the entity expressing contrastive topic is in situ, through a probe-goal configuration (Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2008).

The puzzle is this. A sentence like (i) \"You\\'re allowed to draw at most 3 cards\" has a so-called \"authoritative reading\", characterized by two kinds of inferences: an upper-bound (UB) inference, viz. that you\\'re not allowed to draw more than 3 cards, and a free-choice (FC) inference, viz. that you\\'re allowed to draw any number of cards in the range [0,3]. On standard assumptions about the meanings of \"allow\" and \"at most 3\", however, a surface-scope analysis predicts only a weak literal meaning, from which neither an UB nor a FC inference logically follows. What\\'s more, \"at least n\" does not give rise to an analogous authoritative reading: (ii) \"You\\'re allowed to draw at least 3 cards\" cannot be used to convey that you\\'re allowed to draw 3 or more cards, with FC in the range [3, ...], and a lower bound that prohibits drawing 2 cards or fewer. The puzzle, then, has two parts: Why does (i) have an upper-bounded authoritative reading, and why does (ii) not have an analogous lower-bounded authoritative reading? We present new data that broaden the scope of the puzzle and that, we argue, challenge the decompositional, split-scope solution articulated in Penka 2014. We then offer a new (but partial), surface-scope solution based on a conservative amendment of the recursive exhaustification approach to FC disjunction as laid out in Fox 2007.',\n",

He thus submits that the computation of scalar implicatures is not blind but just contextually “short-sighted”: it can ignore certain pieces of common knowledge, but it is not required to ignore all of it. In this paper, I show that Schlenker’s proposal is a technical mistake: Short-sightedness is provably equivalent to Blindness under natural assumptions on the set of scalar alter- natives. Short-sightedness thus provides no new ammunitions against Hirschberg’s challenge. I then take a closer look at the challenge, through some initial evidence that contextually ordered alternatives are restricted and dependent on specific lexical choices. I conjecture that these choices share the property of introducing more logical structure than meets the eye, thus possibly providing the logical ordering required by Blindness (or the equivalent Short-sightedness).

       "  'This dissertation investigates experimentally the role of Question-Answer Congruence (QAC, von Stechow 1990, Rooth 1985, 1992) in child language acquisition and adult sentence processing. Specifically, I present two case studies: sentences with “only” and sentences with the Rise-Fall-Rise contour (RFR, Jackendoff 1972).\\r\\n     Case study 1 investigates a long-standing puzzle concerning the acquisition of “only.” Since Crain et al.(1994), many studies report children display difficulties understanding sentences with pre-subject “only” while having no difficulty with pre-verbal “only.” The current study manipulates the levels of QAC to study the puzzle. The results show that QAC plays a significant role in the asymmetry between Subject-only vs. VP-only, and more generally, both children and adults are sensitive to QAC, with congruence facilitating processing, and incongruence interfering with processing. We conclude that the cost of the accommodation of a sub-question to obey QAC is different for Subject-only and VP-only. I propose that the way information is packaged makes it easier to accommodate a set of questions asking about the object of the sentence, which makes it easier to process VP-only. \\r\\n     We also showed that the extent to which QAC influences comprehension is different for children and adults. For children, QAC has a stronger influence than the syntactic condition on only. For adults, the syntactic condition is not violated. We suggest that the status of the syntactic condition regarding only is a factor that distinguishes children from adults in the processing of only.\\r\\n     Case study 2 investigates whether children can construe the inverse scope interpretation, which children are reported to disfavor (Musolino 1998), with the RFR prosody, which is standardly taken to require inverse scope. The results show that both children and adults are sensitive to RFR and able to compute the implicature associated with RFR to disambiguate the inverse scope interpretation.\\r\\n     As in the “only” study, QAC levels varied in the RFR experiment. However, the results revealed no effect of question type. This leaves an important open question: why QAC seems more active in children in determining the associate of only than in the determination of quantifier scope when the prosody makes the scope clear.',\n",

Chomsky shuns evolutionary arguments, asserting simply that language was instantaneously installed. Zahavi argues that language entails reliance on low cost conventional signals whose evolutionary emergence would contradict basic Darwinian theory.

In general, the paper argues that there is no a priori way to connect intuitions of sentential deviance to a particular type of explanation, however these different sources of anomaly often make different empirical predictions. The paper both evaluates the general strategies behind each theory and demonstrates how to compare different types of theories (in particular, the presuppositional theory and the syntactic theory) by discussing a detailed case study: namely the distribution of quantifiers with respect to the mass-count distinction. In this case study, the syntactic explanation fairs better than the semantic and pragmatic approaches to the problem. Even thought the syntactic theory ends up providing the best explanation of the facts, it is important to note that the syntactic theory developed in this paper would not have been possible without the insights gained from the attempted pragmatic and semantic explanations. In other words, it is vital to linguistic inquiry to approach problems from multiple perspectives to get a better understanding of the empirical landscape and possible grammatical generalizations.',\n",

Three behavioral experiments aimed at quantifying the relationship between PAV semantic properties and PAV syntactic distribution are reported. Experiment 1 gathers a measure of PAV syntactic distributions using an acceptability judgment task. Experiments 2 and 3 gather measures of semantic similarity between those same PAVs using a generalized semantic discrimination (triad or “odd man out”) task and an ordinal (likert) scale task, respectively. Two kinds of analyses are conducted on the data from these experiments. The first compares both the acceptability judgments and the semantic similarity judgments to classifications of PAVs derived from traditional distributional analysis. The second compares the acceptability judgments to the semantic similarity judgments directly. Through these comparisons, we show that there is quite fine-grained information about PAV semantics in PAV syntactic distributions—whether one considers the sorts of discrete qualitative classifications that linguists traditionally work with or the sorts of continuous quantitative classifications that can be derived experimentally.',\n",

The shared insight behind these models is that languages with prosodic focus marking assign prosodic prominence only within elements which constitute material critical for successful interpretation. We first take care to distinguish the information-structural notion of (contrastive) focus from an ontologically distinct notion of givenness marking, and then outline the core properties of focus. We then introduce a signaling game between a speaker and hearer in which the goal is to transmit semantic content with the smallest signal possible. We apply the Iterated Best Response (IBR) method of Franke (2011) to find equilibrium strategies in this game, where a unique equilibrium strategy in this case picks out the “critical information” of an utterance, which by hypothesis constitutes its focus. We show that iterating this game at different syntactic levels of a sentence makes correct predictions about the role of contrast in determining stress within words and phrases, and can be extended to account for association and second occurrence focus effects.',\n",

       "  \"While it is now accepted that sign languages should inform and constrain theories of 'Universal Grammar', their role in 'Universal Semantics' has been under-studied. We argue that they have a crucial role to play in the foundations of semantics, for two reasons. First, in some cases sign languages provide overt evidence on crucial aspects of the Logical Form of sentences,  onces that are only inferred indirectly in spoken language. For instance, sign language 'loci', which are positions in signing space that can arguably realize logical variables; they make it possible to revisit foundational debates about the syntactic reality of variables, mechanisms of temporal and modal anaphora, and the existence of dynamic binding. Another example pertains to mechanisms of 'context shift', which were postulated on the basis of indirect evidence in spoken language, but which are arguably realized overtly in sign language. Second, along one dimension sign languages are strictly more expressive than spoken languages because iconic phenomena can be found at their logical core. This applies to loci themselves, which may simultaneously be logical variables and simplified pictures of what they denote; and context shift comes with some iconic requirements as well.  As a result, the semantic system of spoken languages can in some respects be seen as a 'degenerate' version of the richer semantics found in sign languages. Two conclusions could be drawn from this observation. One is that the full extent of Universal Semantics can only be studied in sign language. An alternative possibility is that spoken languages have comparable expressive mechanisms, but only when co-speech gestures are taken into account. Either way, sign languages have a crucial role to play in investigations of the foundations of semantics.\",\n",

Like cases of reflexivity in many languages (see Reinhart and Reuland, 1993; Jayaseelan, 1997; Reuland, 2001b, 2011, for an overview), this dependency is distinguished from other cases of anaphora in the language by being specially marked. This in turn suggests that reflexivity is special and requires recourse to additional grammatical devices than do standard cases of anaphora where the antecedent and anaphor are not co-arguments. Of particular importance here will be the structural interaction between grammatical perspective, represented along the mental and/or spatio-temporal dimensions in a syntactic perspectival phrase or PerspP (Sundaresan, 2012) and reflexivity.',\n",

[2] What information is shared between the syntactic and phonological modules of natural language grammar? It makes several proposals regarding possible mappings of syntactic structures to surface word order, and the role that phonological information plays in syntactic derivations. It argues that phonological considerations can influence word order by determining the optimal pronunciation of movement copies, and that some syntactic operations are driven by requirements to produce phonologically licit structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first few chapters examine the role of the Phonetic Form (PF) grammar in the linearization of movement copies and in the creation of prosodic structure. It presents an analysis of a puzzling pattern in Bangla (a.k.a. Bengali) that involves variation in the placement of the subordinating complementizer je. It is shown that previous analyses, which rely purely on grammatical or discourse properties, do not adequately account for the pattern. New data on Bangla prosody is presented to argue that variation in complementizer placement is driven by a grounded phonological constraint against the placement of je in the initial position of an Intonational Phrase. This leads to an implementation of the PF component as an Optimality-Theoretic grammar in which phonological and syntactic well-formedness conditions compete to determine the optimal pronunciation of movement copies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the dissertation turns to the accessibility of phonological information to syntactic operations. It proposes the existence of a syntactic operation, Coalescence, which bundles structurally adjacent heads into a single, featurally complex head. This operation derives variation in how category features are realized on heads, as well as certain types of head-adjunction and cliticization. It is argued that the application of Coalescence is properly motivated and constrained by a requirement to eliminate heads that would be deficient in their phonological realization, suggesting that a restricted amount of information about phonological exponence is visible to syntactic operations. The approach is illustrated in analyses of cross-linguistic variation in the realization of positions within the clausal left periphery and the inflectional domain, with a focus on verb second effects and verb movement.',\n",

Taking a Minimalist perspective, this dissertation shows that the available generative accounts of case in SA are problematic either theoretically or empirically. It is argued that these problems can be overcome using the hybrid dependent case theory of Baker (2015).\\r\\nThis theory makes a distinction between two types of phases. The first is the hard phase, which disallows the materials inside it from being accessed by higher phases. The second is the soft phase, which allows the materials inside it to be accessed by higher phases.\\r\\nThe results of this dissertation indicate that in SA (a) the CP is a hard phase in that noun phrases inside this phase are inaccessible to higher phases for the purpose of case assignment. In contrast, vP is argued to be a soft phase in that the noun phrases inside this phase are still accessible to higher phases for the purposes of case assignment (b) the DP, and the PP are also argued to be hard phases in SA, (c) case assignment in SA follows a hierarchy such that lexical case applies before the dependent case, the dependent case applies before the Agree-based case assignment, the Agree-based case assignment applies before the unmarked/default case assignment, (d) case assignment in SA is determined by a parameter, which allows the dependent case assignment to apply to a noun phrase if it is c-commanded by another noun phrase in the same Spell-Out domain (TP or VP), (e) the rules of dependent case assignment require that the NPs involved have distinct referential indices.\\r\\nThe major conclusion of the dissertation is that the functional head v in SA is a soft phase head, due to its deficient ɸ-specification. That is why it is incapable of establishing an Agree relation with the object and assigning the structural accusative case to it. The structural accusative case on the object is, therefore, always the result of the dependent case mechanism.',\n",

Both singular and plural agreement are able to appear with these collective nouns, which are shown to be morphologically singular but semantically plural. Plural agreement however is systematically more restricted than singular agreement, appearing in a subset of the environments where singular agreement is allowed. Restrictions on plural come from the nature of agreement; semantic agreement features can only enter into agreement when the controller of agreement c-commands the target of agreement, whereas morphologically motivated agreement is not subject to the same structural restriction. This asymmetry between the two types of agreement is shown to arise from the proposal that AGREE (Chomsky 2000, 2001) is distributed over the syntactic and post-syntactic component (Arregi & Nevins 2012).',\n",

While Luganda appears to systematically lack a Vergnaud licensing requirement, Makhuwa more consistently displays evidence in favour of it, as do all of the analytic languages that we survey (Mandarin, Yoruba, Jamaican Creole and Thai).

       "  '[Deo, 2015] is the first study applying mathematically explicit evolutionary analysis to a specific semantic-change phenomenon, namely the progressive-imperfective diachronic cycle. The empirically observed cycle is as follows. It starts with grammar (a) where only one form X is used both for progressive and imperfective meanings. Then in (b), an optional progressive marker Y is innovated; in (c), Y becomes the obligatory marker for progressive meanings, while X still marks the imperfective. At the final stage (d), old form X dies out altogether, and Y expresses both the imperfective and the progressive. Deo’s original model, though reaching (d) from (a), does not predict that either (b) or (c) is learned by all speakers in the community. This paper improves on that result. I show that it is not possible to get exactly the expected sequence (a)→(b)→(c)→(d), but we can approach it better than the original analysis. The outcomes we get are: (i) (b) is never spoken by all speakers; (ii) (b) and (c) are spoken by all, but (d) is not reached; (iii) all four stages occur, but back-shifts such as (c)→(b) also appear. At the moment, there are no empirical data of sufficient temporal granularity to either support or falsify predictions (ii) and (iii). This highlights the value of explicit evolutionary modeling of meaning change: through evolutionary analysis we show that Deo’s theory of the progressive-imperfective cycle makes a novel and unexpected, but practically testable empirical prediction.',\n",

Exploring the behavior of ethnic slurs in the presence of other regular expressive elements, I show the systematicity of how various expressive items interact with one another. For this purpose, looking at Korean is advantageous since it extensively makes use of expressives across lexical categories. In doing so, I try to answer two main questions that haven’t been taken seriously before. First, the multiple occurrences of identical expressives are known to be possible, but what about co-occurrences of different expressives with varying atti- tudes, including the conflicting ones? Do they freely occur within one utterance? If not, what constrains their compatibility condition and the degree of the compatibility? To solve this puzzle, I investigate the dynamic paradigm of multiple expressives. I propose the Compatibility Condition Model (CCM) and the Compatibility Condition Index (CCI), showing how a language like Korean constrains the possible co-occurrences of various types of expressives such as slurs, epithets, anti-honorifics, intensifiers, or mitigators. Second, how strict is the Compatibility Condition of expressives, and what happens if the condition is flouted? I show how in practice people intentionally flout the Compatibility Condition to achieve various pragmatic effects, presenting four interesting cases: (i) the juxtaposition of opposite attitudes with stronger pragmatic effects such as sarcasm, irony, or hyperbole; (ii) the well-known flip-flop of bipolar emotional index; (iii) the code-switching at Honorific- dimension as a strategy of modulating social distance; and (iv) the question of whether Emotion- and Honorific-dimensions operate autonomously. The result supports the notion of multidimensionality (Potts, 2005 et seq.) and furthermore the newfound hybrid nature of Conditional Autonomy, i.e., autonomy with intercommunication amongst expressive dimensions.',\n",

       "  'Given that nouns rarely appear in isolation in French, infants acquiring the language must often retrieve the underlying representation of vowel-initial lexical forms from liaison contexts which provide conflicting information about their initial phoneme. Given this ambiguity, how do learners represent these nouns in their lexicon, and how do these representations change as their knowledge of liaison and the lexicon become more adult-like? To explore this question, we analyze the types of errors children make, in both naturalistic and elicited speech, and how these are affected by input frequency. In doing so, we evaluate two major proposals for how children’s early representations of liaison develop. The first model, couched in a constructionist framework, predicts relatively late mastery of liaison (age 5 or older) and heavy dependence on the contexts in which a particular noun appears in the input. The second model, takes an approach to liaison development which integrates it more closely with general phonological development, and predicts relatively early mastery (by age 3). The results of a corpus study reveal that by age 3 children are correctly producing liaison in the nominal domain and that their production errors are consistent with a phonological model of liaison acquisition. An elicitation task demonstrates that 3-year-olds’ succeed at learning and correctly apply their knowledge of liaison to new nouns following brief exposure, though their productions continue to be influenced by nouns’ input distributions. Taken together, our findings suggest that by age 3 children are well on their way to adult-like representations of liaison. A phonologically-based model, incorporating the effect of distributional context on early errors, provides a better overall fit to the data we present.',\n",

       "  'Nominalizing reduplication in American Sign Language (ASL) is an ambiguous process that can derive both concrete object- and result-denoting nominals. The properties of this nominalization process, including this ambiguity, are accounted for here by appealing to the discrete and surface transparent morphology the language uses to encode components of event (Wilbur 2003, 2010) and argument (Benedicto and Brentari 2004) structure. Nominalizing reduplication is shown to be a process that nominalizes (and reduplicates) only the low portion of verbal structure responsible for encoding the event result (VP-Res). Direct nominalization of this VP-Res constituent yields nominals with result-denoting interpretations. Concrete object-denoting interpretations may arise when the verbal structure contains an argument classifier, evident in the handshape of the verbal predicate. In such cases, the nominal argument introduced by the classifier serves as the input to reduced relative clause formation, yielding a concrete object-denoting interpretation. The interpretive ambiguity is thus reduced to ambiguity in the syntactic structure underlying the derived nominal. This approach falls in line with longstanding structural approaches to nominalization and more recent proposals regarding processes of reduplication (Inkelas and Zoll 2005).\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'The aim of this paper is to look comparatively at verbs denoting change of colour or causation of change of color in English and Romanian, pointing out the differences between languages and providing a syntactic representation able to capture their formation.\\r\\nEnglish makes use of three types of verbs/ verbal constructions to denote processes related to colour: (i) verbs whose form is identical to that of the adjective/ noun they are derived from (such as to blue, to gray, to yellow, to brown, to green), (ii) verbs created with the suffix –en (such as to whiten, to blacken, to redden), (iii) verbal paraphrases (such as to turn pink/ orange). In contrast, in Romanian, one can note the use of (i) verbal paraphrases such as a face ca ceva să fie roz/ gri/ maro/ portocaliu ‘to make that something should be pink/ gray/ brown/ orange’, and (ii) verbs created with the prefix în- (a înălbi ‘to prefix-white-verbal suffix’- to whiten, a înnegri ‘to prefix-black-verbal suffix’- to blacken, a înroşi ‘to prefix-red-verbal suffix’- to redden, a îngălbeni ‘to prefix-yellow-verbal suffix’, a înverzi ‘to prefix-green-verbal suffix’). Most English colour verbs have the same form as the noun/ adjective they derive from (which is in line with the general observation that English tends to use identical denominal/ deajectival verbs (Hale & Keyser 2002)). Possibly in accordance with Berlin & Kay’s (1973) remark that there is a hierarchy of colours and colour words, the suffix –en in English is used with fundamental colours (red, white, black), while, for the other colours, no suffix is used. In contrast, Romanian uses the prefix în- in almost all cases (but there are exceptions e.g. a roşi ‘to blush’), while using paraphrases with more recent words denoting colours (roz ‘pink’, maro ‘brown’, portocaliu ‘orange’).\\r\\nFrom an aspectual point of view, verbs denoting colour processes are degree achievements (expressing a gradual change of state) (Hay, Kennedy &Levin 1999). They display both telic and atelic properties, combining both with for-phrases and in-phrases (I reddened the wall in 5 minutes, I reddened the wall for an hour). Moreover, they can essentially appear in two structures (an intransitive one: The wall yellowed, and a transitive one: I yellowed the wall). In Romanian, the first structure is expressed with the help of a reflexive clitic (Peretele s-a îngălbenit ‘The wall clitic reflexive-has prefix-yellowed’), while the transitive form is similar to the one in English (Am îngălbenit peretele ‘Have yellowed the wall’).\\r\\nCombining Ramchand’s analysis (2008, 2014) with Brody’s (2000) idea that the intermediary level should be eliminated, I embrace the view that words spell out a span, i.e. a complement sequence of heads (@ indicates where the span spells out, and * the formation of a word with the head immediately below). I discuss a causative and locative meaning of -en and în- for English and Romanian (to redden= to cause to pass in a state of red).',\n",

I propose that Mandarin has a T(ense) projection in its clause structure, which is headed by a phonologically null element ∅yǒu in a non-future episodic sentence. It is optionally pronounced as yǒu when the negation marker méi moves obligatorily out of its base position under Neg(ation) to attach to it in a non-future negative episodic sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence to support this proposal comes from the fact that ∅yǒu (/méiyǒu) demonstrates two major properties of a T(ense) head: the location of the temporal interpretation of a sentence and the divider of interpretation domains for quantifiers, as proposed in Diesing’s (1992) Mapping Hypothesis. Semantic analyses on the temporality of a non-future eventive episodic sentence in Mandarin show that its temporal interpretation is located on ∅yǒu. It is realized as yǒu phonologically, when the negation marker méi undergoes obligatory head movement from Neg to attach to it in a non-future negative episodic sentence. This constitutes the first piece of evidence for the TP proposal for Mandarin. The second piece of evidence comes from the observation that strong or presuppositional quantifiers, which include not only canonical ones such as měigèrén (‘everyone’) but also non-canonical ones such as universal free choice expressions (wúlùn) wh- dōu (‘no matter wh-’) and scalar quantifiers such as (lián)…dōu (‘even’), are interpreted above ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu), whereas weak or existential quantifiers such as yǒurén (‘someone’) or méiyǒurén (‘nobody’) and yǒu/méiyǒu-existential sentences are interpreted below ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu). This property of ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu) is consistent with the role played by T in Diesing’s (1992) Mapping Hypothesis, which says that presuppositional quantifiers are interpreted above T and existential quantifiers are interpreted below it.',\n",

This current change in progress has never been observed before, probably because it is so slow that it is undetectable without the aid of multiple diachronic parsed corpora (treebanks) with time-depths of over 500 years each. In fact, building on insights from Kiparsky (1995), the change may date as far back as the innovation of Proto-Germanic and Proto-Romance relative clauses, as these varieties differentiated from Proto-Indo-European. The study also shows that the unusually slow speed of the change is due to partial specialization of the construction along the dimension of prosodic weight, following the argument made at greater length in Fruehwald & Wallenberg (in prep). Finally, the change is shown to have important consequences for the syntax of extraposition, supporting the adjunction analysis of Culicover & Rochemont (1990). The paper also discusses the implications of Sauerland (2003) analysis of English relative clauses, and while modern English data supports his analysis, the diachronic extraposition data is not yet fine-grained enough to bear on the \"raising\" analysis of relatives in general.

Against this background, we look at an alternation in vocalic length that can be found with a couple of prefixes in Czech. We argue that the best way to understand this alternation is in terms of their free/bound status. Hence, we propose that despite the fact that the prefixes are always glued to the verb, they actually undergo the same process as Germanic particles. The reason why they are always glued to the verb is because of the way pied-piping works; when the verb moves, it moves as a big phrase and always carries the particle along.',\n",

In the case of number, this never results in a clash. Instead, there will be omnivorous number: the verb shows plural agreement whenever at least one of the feature bundles is specified as plural. By contrast, in the case of person this situation can lead to a clash. This accounts for the impossibility of having a lower nominative with a different person specification than the subject in both Icelandic quirky subject constructions and Dutch clefts. Those cases where a verb does show omnivorous person agreement are the result of language-specific person hierarchies used for resolution.

We argue that this prefix is a low applicative head, licensing the addition of a LOCATIVE DP argument to the intransitive verbal root. Specifically, this applicative head: (i) case- and theta-licenses the added argument, but being void of phi features, it blocks its cliticization; (ii) is distinct from a homophonous free standing P semantically and syntactically; (iii) is undergoing grammaticalization, as evidenced by the emergence of a novel configuration, in which the locative predicates combine with locative PPs that retrieve semantic and syntactic information of the locative prefix.

       "  'A unified explanation is proposed for two differences between English and Chinese. In English answering ‘no’ to a negative yes-no question confirms the negative alternative, in Chinese it disconfirms the negative alternative. In Chinese, particularly Taiwanese, the answer cannot be a bare negative answer particle, in English it can be. At the same time two theories of the syntax of questions are compared. One claims that the yes-no question particle maps the content proposition of the question, positive or negative, to a set consisting of it and its negation, and the answer  confirms or disconfirms the content proposition. The other claims that the yes-no question contains a polarity variable assigned a value by the answer. It is argued that most yes-no questions in Taiwanese conform to the first theory, while most yes-no questions in English conform to the second. The reason why the answer ‘no’ in Taiwanese has to be supplemented with spelled out sentential material is that the sentence inherited from the question cannot be deleted because it is modified by the answer particle, hence is not identical with its antecedent. In English the inherited sentence is assigned a polarity value by the answer particle. It can thereby be identical, in Merchant’s (2001) sense, with the antecedent sentence, and be deleted.  ',\n",

Modality- specific properties of either sign or speech must instead be attributed to the interaction of the linguistic system with the systems of production and perception. This chapter explores both the modality-independent and the modality-dependent properties of syntactic categorization in sign languages. Categorization of linguistic expressions and the use of categorical properties to determine syntactic distribution and guide syntactic structure building appear to be modality-independent properties of language, as are the broad categorical divisions attested (e.g., lexical vs. functional, noun vs. verb). When the examination turns to fine-grained categorical or sub-categorical distinctions and the actual morpho-syntactic patterns that distinguish these categories within a given language or class of languages, however, certain patterns of modality-dependence do emerge, such as the sign language preference for simultaneous (vs. sequential) structure. Nevertheless, as in other areas of language study, the patterns attested in syntactic categorization in sign languages overlap significantly with those documented in spoken languages. This provides further support for the proposal that the properties of human language are not primarily driven by the modality of transmission but are only secondarily beholden to it.',\n",

The study is driven within\\r\\nthe framework of the Minimalist Program, a theory initiated and developed by Noam Chomsky in the 1990s. On the one hand, the morphological study of adverbs establishes a clear morphological difference between the adverbs classes that exist in this language, while, on the other hand, the syntactic study provides the unmarked positions and the hierarchy of adverbs within a given structure.\\r\\nBased on empirical data, the results of the study show that Shupamem has both pure and derived adverbs. The derivation processes are affixation, adjunction, reduplication and substitution. The syntactic study shows that in Shupamem, adverbs can be right-adjoined or left-adjoined to the verb. It also shows that some adverbs allow movements through focalization and topicalization, (higher class adverbs\\r\\nand post-verbal lower class adverbs), while for others, movements are impossible or constrained (pre-verbal low class adverbs). The results also show that the hierarchy between post-verbal adverbs is highly flexible, given that a locative adverb can come before or after a manner adverb, a temporal adverb, and a degree adverb etc., this order being reversible. Furthermore, following the Ciquean (1999) Fixed Hierarchy Hypothesis, this study provides the hierarchy of adverbs in Shupamem, a hierarchy that remains flexible as far as post-verbal adverbs are concerned.

We offer a semantic account of epistemic modal adverbs that captures their distribution in patterns typically known as modal concord (see Huitink 2012, 2014), but which we will call 'modal spread'. Modal spread is not usually discussed in the context of positive polarity, but we argue that it is instrumental in revealing an additional argument of modality, namely a function that reflects the speaker's perspective. We show that the perspective is always positive, which is crucial to understanding the novel observation that negative modal adverbs do not exist. We show that by analyzing modal verbs as having a presupposition of positive bias which survives negation, we can capture the fact that both the modal and the adverb scope above negation.\",\n",

At the same time, a wealth of studies has emerged on sign languages, investigating the impact of a different modality (visual vs. auditory) on linguistic systems. These two recent developments taken together raise the following question: is there a gestural counterpart of music, the study of which could shed new light on human cognition? \\r\\nThe hypothesis that this paper investigates, using formal methods, is that there exists a grammar of dance, i.e., cognitive structures underlying the understanding of dance movement, a counterpart of music in the visual modality. Specifically, we ask: what are the primitive elements of dance (cf. phonology)? What are the rules of combination (cf. prosody/morphology/syntax)? What is the meaning of dance if any (cf. semantics)?\\r\\nThe paper is a first attempt to address the first two questions by examining some organizational principles of the mental representation of dance perception. Specifically, the grouping structure of dance is explored in details, based on Gestalt principles and their adaptation to music by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), while other types of hierarchical structures such as metrical structure are briefly discussed.\\r\\nUltimately, the goal is to elaborate a theory of dance cognition, which should shed further light on cognitive systems by distinguishing between general cognitive properties and modality-specific or domain-specific properties. In particular, the specific cognitive relation between music and dance should be clarified.',\n",

In the case of short-vowel stød that mora lacks segmental content, as it is projected top-down due to local prosodic requirements, not bottom-up by segmental material. I show that this device provides an account of the distribution of short-vowel stød as arising from the interplay of constraints on metrical structure (both lexically stored and computed by the grammar) and the requirement for morae to be featurally licensed. The analysis provides further evidence for the analysis of ‘tonal accents’ and related phenomena in terms of metrical structure rather than lexical tone or laryngeal features, and contributes to our understanding of the relationship between segmental and suprasegmental phonology in Germanic languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally published in Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics 19(3), 221–268, doi:10.1007/s10828-016-9083-8.

Tense in Mandarin Chinese sentences. Syntax 18:320–342] argues for the positive view. The argument is based on the premise that Mandarin clauses exhibit finite/nonfinite contrasts and that finiteness is a property of Tense. In this paper, I argue that the contrasts identified by Lin can all be adequately accounted for without appealing to Tense. The primary conclusion then is that there is no positive evidence for Tense in Mandarin. A secondary conclusion is that Mandarin can nonetheless be said to exhibit a finite/nonfinite distinction, but only if ‘finiteness’ is construed broadly as a cluster of properties that enable a clause to stand alone as a syntactically unembedded assertion. Phenomena considered in making this argument include both those discussed by Lin (object fronting, wide scope of object-position quantifiers, and a scopal interaction between modals and aspect) as well as the syntax of subject position and the grammar of control.',\n",

For example, when the classifier -ts’ijty is used with the noun ja’as, it is understood that ja’as denotes a set of bananas, whereas when -tyejk is used, ja’as is understood as denoting a set of banana trees. Critically, it can be demonstrated that this effect on the meaning of the noun is non-local in the sense that it occurs within a syntactic domain that is completely independent of the classifier. Furthermore, there are strong arguments that the meanings of all sortal classifiers like -ts’ijty and -tyejk are essentially the same, namely the cardinality measure function μ#. We hypothesize that there are two possible explanations for the non-local effects of classifiers. One is that the lexical interpretation function is sensitive to non-local syntactic contexts, much like vocabulary insertion rules within Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz, 1993). The other is that there are learned, pragmatic conventions that influence how speakers interpret an implicit context-set variable (Westerstahl, 1985). We discuss evidence from noun phrase ellipsis which favours the latter explanation.',\n",

Using existing nouns (e.g. Architekt, architecte, architect) as a baseline, we found evidence that the German AN constructions under investigation exhibit a memorization advantage in comparison to the French AN/NA constructions. We attribute the effect to the compound status of the German constructions as well as their morphological origin, in contrast to the syntactic source of the French constructions. For the English constructions, we considered stress (YOUNG tourist vs. young TOURist) to be a determining factor, which we hypothesized to interact with semantic compositionality. This interplay was examined in a second study, which revealed that non-compositional structures with initial stress (e.g. HARD shirt) gave rise to compound-like effects in comparison to the phrase-like compositional constructions with non-initial stress (e.g. short BRUSH).

When they combine with distributive predicates, they intuitively impose a kind of upper bound, whereas when they combine non-distributive predicates, they do not (they sometimes even impose a lower bound). We propose and explore in detail four solutions to this puzzle, each involving some notion of maximality, but differing in the type of maximality involved (\\'standard\\' maximality vs. \\'informativity-based\\' maximality) and in the source of maximality (lexically encoded in the meaning of the numeral modifier vs. non-lexical). While the full range of data we consider do not conclusively favor one theory over the other three, we do argue that overall the evidence (i) goes against the view that modified numerals lexically encode a \\'standard\\' maximality operator, and (ii) suggests the need for a pragmatic blocking mechanism that filters out readings (logical forms) of sentences that are generated by the grammar but intuitively unavailable.',\n",

Verb suppletion in the language requires the domain of contextual allomorphy to extend beyond both a maximal projection (Bobaljik 2012) and syntactic sisterhood (Bobaljik and Harley 2013). But the outer limits of this domain remain out of sight, at least in Northern Paiute. Verb suppletion exhibits an intervention effect: the trigger must be the closest possible trigger.

In this work we discuss the similarity collection procedure for a multi-category dataset that avoids score ambiguity and suggest changes to the evaluation procedure to reflect the insights of psychological literature for word, phrase and sentence similarity.

More recent research has identified a number of extra-phonological motivations for this clitic placement, making a prosodic explanation seem superfluous. The present study addresses the question whether Old Spanish, a clear Tobler–Mussafia language, differs in its prosodic patterns from Modern Spanish, which does not show the Tobler–Mussafia placement any longer. The comparison of the data shows that Old Spanish tolerates more sentence-initial unstressed monosyllables and unstressed pretonic syllables at the sentence beginning than Modern Spanish does, contrary to expectations. Together with the observation that the direction of clitic attachment is rather due to the prosodic context (i.e. the immediate preceding or following prosodic words and potential Phonological Phrase boundaries) than to a fixed directionality parameter, this falsifies the hypothesis that the clitic placement pattern in the TML language Old Spanish is due to specific prosodic patterns.',\n",

       "  'This dissertation is about the basic building blocks that make up words, and how these building blocks interact with the rest of the grammar. The grammar is generally viewed as an inventory of contentful units and the rules governing their combination. One question for linguistic theory is what these units might be like. Are they different for different languages? A second question is how these pieces are put together, and again we ask whether these combinatory processes are the same in different languages. A third question is to ask what we can build. This study concentrates on building verbs, specifically how the grammar builds their structure in a way that then constrains semantic interpretation and phonological pronunciation.\\r\\n|\\r\\nThe empirical domain is the verbal system of Modern Hebrew, where this work attempts to unify our treatment of concatenative and non-concatenative morphology. The hypothesis put forward is that hierarchical syntactic structure, once generated, must be interpreted according to specific locality constraints when transferred to the interfaces with semantics and phonology. At each interface additional calculations take place. These calculations are interface-particular: semantics and phonology are not identical objects of study. Yet the two have in common a locality constraint on calculations that derives directly from the syntactic structure. In addition, individual lexical items (\"roots\") place their own requirements on the meaning and/or the pronunciation. The theory developed here limits this influence of roots to the two interfaces, making the claim that individual roots have no syntactic features. Nevertheless, roots are active at the interfaces in ways that are predictable once the right generalizations are sought out. The phonological form of roots is relevant at the phonology and their lexical semantics is relevant at the semantics: roots have no syntactic features, only interface requirements.\\r\\n|\\r\\nHebrew, being a contemporary Central Semitic language, shows the kind of non-concatenative, \"root-and-pattern\" morphology that is organized around consonantal \"roots\" and prosodic \"templates\", the latter consisting of a prosodic shape, certain vowels and an affix. The account put forward argues that Hebrew roots are abstract lexical elements which combine with discrete syntactic functional heads. The combination, once fed through the phonology of the language, results in morphophonological templates which are not primitives of the system in and of themselves. The architecture defended supports the view of constrained interpretation at the interfaces which lies at the core of this proposal, using non-hierarchical surface forms in order to mount an argument for hierarchical structure.\\r\\n| of the dissertation introduces the issues at hand and the basics of the Hebrew verbal system. It also reviews a number of earlier approaches which help set the stage for the analysis that follows.\\r\\n| develops the syntactic-semantic part of the proposal, defining the syntactic elements needed to derive verbal morphology both for Hebrew and crosslinguistically. It is shown that the different combinations of these elements produce the verbal system of Hebrew in a way that is constrained, in the semantics, by the lexical idiosyncrasies of individual roots.\\r\\n| takes the proposed structures and manipulates them in the phonological component of the grammar. The view of linearization pursued here is shown to make correct predictions. The effect of different classes of roots is highlighted, and the point is made that verbal templates are not holistic morphemes but the spell-out of distinct functional heads.\\r\\n| takes a quantitative approach, surveying previous psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic work on Semitic languages and presenting novel findings from a recent magnetoencephalography experiment. These findings support the claims made in the previous chapters regarding the organization of the system.\\r\\n| considers how the child might acquire this system. Recent developmental findings are surveyed and a novel computational model is discussed. This chapter outlines a model of Semitic acquisition in which the consonantal character of roots is used as a learning cue, leading to acquisition of basic verbal templates and eventually the system as a whole.\\r\\n| concludes, recapitulating the main contributions of this work: derivations in a generative grammar combine rigid grammatical principles with unstructured lexical material.

In fact, it is not (properly speaking) allomorphy at all - in the sense that there is no selection between different morphs. This forms part of a program that attempts to remove class features from generative grammar. Eradicating noun class features, as is done for this data, allows for a more elegant and minimalist analysis with a clear demarcation between the features of semantic interpretation (e.g. [+fem]) and the features of phonological form (e.g. [+high]). In this way it upholds the architecture of grammar made popular by distributed morphology. In this problematic case study, we see that Afar nominal paradigms are characterized by both the introduction of features/melody and paradigm-specific stress shifts. The proposed re-analysis relies heavily on the notion of catalexis. Using a Strict CV representational model, I propose that nouns in Afar are always trochaic. The tripartite difference in the shape of nominal roots is reduced to what part of the trochee’s dependent CV is filled by melody: both C and V (V-Masc) [ˈbara] ‘night’, only C (C-Masc) [maˈtuk] ‘butter’ or neither (Fem) [ħaˈdo] ‘meat’. The shape of these roots juxtaposed with the shape of the Afar affixes regularly predicts the ‘allomorphy’. The underlying form of the proposed affixes have an unusual structural condition, though one that is predicted by foundational autosegmental principles. These come with both features and skeletal structure unassociated to each other. Consequently, following my proposal, affixation can simultaneously introduce features and induce stress shift in a DM-compatible item-and-arrangement analysis, all the while without recourse to class features.',\n",

       "  \"A'-movement in Gitksan (Tsimshianic) morphologically and syntactically distinguishes between the extraction of intransitive subjects, transitive subjects, and objects. Despite the tripartite appearance of this system, I suggest that this pattern instantiates a ban on the extraction of ergatives. The main piece of evidence for this claim comes from a similar construction that surfaces in long- distance extraction from adjunct clauses. Both agent extraction and long-distance extraction from adjunct clauses are characterized by a pre-predicative morpheme an and a dependent clause remnant (contra intransitive subject and object extraction). I suggest that an, which is also a productive nominalizer in Gitksan is appearing in these constructions as a ‘fix’ for otherwise illicit extraction of ergatives, as well as from adjunct clauses. This can provide a piece of counter-evidence to a recent claim that head-marking languages cannot have extraction restrictions (Deal 2016).\\r\\n\",\n",

I suggest that ergative extraction construction in Gitksan involves a nominalisation construction as a alternative to the (illicit) movement of a transitive subject. One piece of evidence for this claim is that the morpheme involved in agent extraction constructions (an) is also a nominaliser. I also present new evidence that a similar construction is utilised in Gitksan to ‘fix’ otherwise illicit long-distance extractions from clauses that attach as adjuncts.

We will argue that particles and resultatives that belong to the former group are merged in a specifier position, while those belonging to the latter group are merged in the verb’s complement.

This quasi-holistic movement is labelled as Defective Predicate Topicalization (DPT), where all predicate elements, apart from Tense, move overtly to Topic Phrase. Linear order between the L-verb, the DO, and any accompanying adjuncts is assumed, among others, to be evidence supporting this contention.

Noonan argues that a comparative approach to these closely related Germanic languages warrants the decomposition of function words into parts not traditionally recognised as morphemes. The morphemes making up locative pronouns such as Dutch daar/German da ‘there’, and place adpositions (e.g. German auf, ‘on’) are shown to pronounce different parts of the aforementioned clausal structure.

While treebanks are usually evaluated with a general measure over all the data, linguistic studies often focus on a particular construction or a group of structures. To judge the quality of linguistic evidence in this case, it would be beneficial to estimate annotation quality over all instances of a particular construction. I discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of four approaches to this type of evaluation: manual evaluation of the results, manual evaluation of the text, falling back to simpler annotation and searching for particular instances of the construction. Furthermore, I illustrate the approaches using an example from Dutch linguistics, two-verb cluster constructions, and estimate precision and recall for this construction on a large automatically annotated treebank of Dutch. From this, I conclude that a combination of approaches on samples from the treebank can be used to estimate the accuracy of the annotation for the construction of interest.

We question the necessity of [interpretable] and [valued] features for the formulation of Agree. We suggest that more primitive syntactic notions underlie the descriptive label oblique, specifically that of an elementary relator with a part/whole content. Thus the DP embedded under a genitive case/adposition is interpreted as a possessor/whole with respect to a local superordinate DP (the possessum/part). We argue that case/agreement stacking corresponds to the presence of a partial copies of this second argument within the phrasal projection of the relator. In section 2 we apply this analysis to linkers, using Albanian as a case study; we then go on to case/agreement stacking in Punjabi (section 3) and in the Australian languages (e.g. Lardil), which are often taken as the core instantiation of the phenomenon.',\n",

       "  \"We argue that rich data gathered in experimental primatology in the last 40 years can benefit from  analytical methods used in contemporary linguistics. Focusing on the syntactic and especially semantic side, we suggest that these methods could help clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any, do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the 'lexical meaning' of individual calls? (iii) how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve? We address these questions in five case studies pertaining to cercopithecines (Putty-nosed and Blue monkeys, Campbell's monkeys), colobinae (Guereza and King Colobus monkeys), and New World monkeys (Titis). The morphology mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell's -oo) we find a root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call concatenation can be analyzed as conjunction. But a key question concerns the division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context ('world' knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation in the semantics (Campbell's krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of 'urgency', whereby threat-related calls must come early in sequences (another potential case of non-compositionality – Colobus snort-roar sequences – might justify  assigning non-compositional meanings to complex calls, but results are tentative). Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in complex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context. With respect to call evolution, we suggest that the remarkable preservation of call form and function over millions years should make it possible to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, which we illustrate with cercopithecine booms, and with a comparative analysis of Blue monkey and Putty-nosed monkey repertoires.  Throughout, we aim to compare possible theories rather than to fully adjudicate between them, and our claims are correspondingly modest. But we hope that our methods could lay the groundwork for a formal monkey linguistics combining data from primatology with formal techniques from linguistics (from which it does not follow that the calls under study share non-trivial properties, let alone an evolutionary history, with human language).\",\n",

In English and many other languages, this inference can be shown to be defeasible, and so is therefore non-semantic. However, in other languages – such as the Tlingit language (Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon) – the cessation inference of past-marked statives cannot be cancelled in the same way. This has lead some to propose that in these latter languages, the cessation inference is semantic, and is lexically encoded into the meaning of the past marker (Leer 1991, Copley 2005). Such a view would, of course, broaden the range of semantic tenses that exist in the world’s languages, to include a sub-category some have dubbed ‘Discontinuous Past’ (Plungian & van der Auwera 2006). Through in-depth investigation of one such putative ‘discontinuous past’ marker in the Tlingit language, I argue that – to the contrary – these morphemes are in their lexical semantics simply (plain) past tenses. On the basis of original field data I show that – while the cessation inferences of Tlingit are different from English-style ‘cessation implicatures’ – they are nevertheless still defeasible, and so non-semantic. I develop a formalized account of the cessation inference in Tlingit, whereby it arises from the optionality of the past-tense marker in question. I argue that this account should be extended to all putative instances of ‘Discontinuous Past’, since it would capture the fact that putative cases of ‘Discontinuous Past’ only ever arise in optional tense languages.',\n",

       "  'Operative Motivating Hypotheses of This Paper:\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduce artefactitious complexity and preclude the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language?  \\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enable solutions of otherwise intractable problems and otherwise enable a wider set of more generalized and more naturalistic solutions?\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes theorizing based on linguistic intent lead to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax? \\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the inclusion of linguistic intent in generative rules motivate the processes of Merge and Move as the essence of human language syntax? \\r\\n\\r\\nAre there alternate paths to explanatory theories beyond Chomksy’s programmatic axioms? We propose and motivate Tool Grammar, in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts. \\r\\nWe present and defend empirically transparent and radically penetrating mechanisms for constraining the notion of a human language in support of the primary Chomskyan goal of explaining infinite linguistic creativity from finite resources and rapid child language learning in the context of poverty of stimulus data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguage has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.    Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A vast swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. When syntactic phenomena are understood to be conditioned by linguistic action/intent descriptors, difficult problems yield to straightforward solutions: conflicting intents yield ill-formed sentences. When generalizations are sought at an incorrect and incapable level of representation, unnatural and unnecessarily contrived solutions unavoidably result.  By incorporating intention action directives into linguistic structure building, syntactic problems generally acquire a facilitative pragmatic resolution: much of syntax is transformed into utilitarian cognitive pragmatics.    Important fundamentals of syntax are reducible to a particular form of cognitive pragmatics and syntax is no longer so autonomous a component of linguistic competence.   Much of the Chomskyan Weltanshaung and the resulting theories can be retained and revalidated, but much also is to be gained by refactoring the work product of linguistic science.\\r\\n\\r\\nTG represents a sub-paradigmatic shift in syntactic theory to the extent it can be integrated to the generative program.  Important Chomskyan tenets are revised but significant elements are retained. Poverty of stimulus, universals, ill-formedness, recursiveness, interpretation, generative capacity, filtering, and so forth are reinterpreted in an alternative architecture of linguistic competence.  Our arguments are launched by considering a range of critical issues in theoretical syntax plus a set of difficult unresolved problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl visited the sick woman.\\r\\nThe sick woman was visited by Al.\\r\\nWhat was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.\\r\\n*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is a tip-of-the-iceberg example of issues that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  This paper presents a range of arguments from linguistic and poetic data that action intents are of the essence in a set of syntactic processes.  When the intentions underlying structural decisions are examined, separate from the internals of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, all three maybe simplified, potentially increasing the constraints on what it is to be a human language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operative hypothesess of this paper include whether linguistic rules must include linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has not heretofore been fully examined. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we demonstrate that optimal linguistic theory is inclined toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  We present a set of problems in  linguistic theory that require the dimension of structural intent for fully empircal solutions to emerge given that intentions are undeniable in the epistemology of language.  The absence of this level of representation in syntactic theory is seen to account for difficulties in advancing the theory in linear progress toward more comprehensive coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe conclude that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactitious complexity and undesirably prcludes the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more naturalistic solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax. The inclusion of linguistic intent in generative rules points toward the processes of Merge and Move as the essence of human language synax?',\n",

       "  'Pseudo Relatives (PRs) are finite constructions found in many Romance languages that look superficially like nouns modified by appositive relative clauses but actually describe events. Typically, the tense of the PR must semantically “match” the matrix tense, and this was thought to be obligatory (Radford 1977, Guasti 1988 a.o.). In Moulton and Grillo (2015), we showed that PRs are referential descriptions of present or past events, and we argued that a null Determiner heading the PR is responsible for this referentiality. Simultaneity conditions on direct perception, then, force tense “matching.” There are, however, previously unobserved cases of “mismatch” with present under perfect (see Casalicchio 2015, for other cases of mismatch). This combination also gives rise to direct perception, but it is only available in Italian and not in other languages that have PRs (e.g. French, Spanish, or Greek). In this paper, we argue that such “tense mismatch” (TMM) PRs refer to Event Kinds (Portner 1991, Carlson 2003, Gehrke to appear, and references cited therein). We show that the propositions within TMM-PRs are habituals, and that via a null determiner, the PR as a whole comes to denote an event kind described by the habitual (e.g. Ferreira 2005). We first demonstrate this with TMM-PRs that combine with kind-taking predicates, and then show that TMM-PRs combine with direct perception verbs by Derived Kind Predication (Chierchia 1998), which accounts for various differences in scope and interpretation between “tense matching” PRs (TM-PRs) and TMM-PRs. Finally we argue that the kind-based DP-account explains why Italian allows TMM-PRs but other PR languages do not.',\n",

       "  'Whenever two related grammatical elements display distinct properties and appear in distinct environments, we have in principle two analytic possibilities: (i) the Inherent View: posit distinctions inherent to the elements themselves, leading to them having different distributions; (ii) the Derived View: posit a single underlying element with a broad distribution, with distinctions arising from the different contexts in which that element appears.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne place where this analytic tension is played out is in the analysis of non-overt subjects in different contexts, i.e. in obligatorily controlled (OC) “PRO” and (little) “pro”. Although, on the surface, the two elements — both silent, pro-forms and occuring typically in subject position — have a great deal in common, we can discern both distributive and interpretive distinctions once we dig a little deeper. OC PRO yields sloppy readings under vP ellipsis, is obligatorily coreferent with a local antecedent and yields obligatory de se readings in attitude contexts. Little pro may be negatively defined with respect to each of these diagnostics. Distributionally, OC PRO seems universal and is the subject of a prototypically non-finite clause; but pro may be the subject or object of a finite clause and is famously parametrized.  It is probably safe to say that it is standard to take an Inherent approach to this distinction (e.g. Chomsky 1982, Martin 2001, Hornstein 1999, Landau 2004, 2013), with PRO treated as being essentially anaphoric and pro treated as being fundamentally pronominal.

In particular, we will empirically motivate the idea that OC PRO, NOC PRO and pro correspond to distinct interpretations of a single underspecified nominal pro-form, \"UPro\", that arise based on what UPro Agrees with in the course of the derivation and to language-specific rules of realization that then apply.

In contrast to ORom and to the other Romance languages, Modern Romanian [MRom] possesses two definite articles, in complementary distribution (Cornilescu 2004): (i) the suffixal article (-l, -a, -i, -le) attaches to the first noun or prenominal adjective of the DP (băiatul boy.DEF, frumosul băiat beautiful.DEF boy); (ii) the freestanding article \"cel\" occurs when the DP-initial position is occupied by a cardinal or ordinal quantifier (cei trei oameni DEF three men). \"Cel\" also occurs in polydefinite DPs, being preceded by a full definite DP (copilul meu cel cuminte child.DEF my DEF nice), with an information structure related function. \\r\\nTheoretically, we distinguish between nominal ellipsis and substantivization. Nominal ellipsis is a Discourse Grammar phenomenon (Williams 1977, López 2000), which presupposes the PF-deletion of an anaphoric constituent otherwise syntactically present. Substantivization is a lexical process, which presupposes the incorporation of a silent noun (Kayne 2005) with a precise lexical content (e.g. [HUMAN] – bolnavul sick.DEF ‘the sick man’; [COLOUR] – galbenul yellow.DEF ‘the yellow colour’), and is not subject to an anaphoricity condition. MRom strictly distinguishes between nominal ellipsis (with \"cel\") and substantivization (with the suffixal article) (Cornilescu, Nicolae 2012).\\r\\nORom, contrasting to MRom, possesses a single definite article, the suffixal one, which is equally used for licensing nominal ellipsis and for substantivization, like in other Romance languages (French, cf. Sleeman 1996). In the 16th century, the structure [past participle + suffixal article] marking nominal ellipsis is rather frequent; however, it gradually disappears by the 19th century. It has currently survived with a few words (bătuta – name of a dance, spusele ‘the said things’). This change is parallel to the grammaticalization of the article \"cel\", which began in the 17th century (Iordan, Manoliu 1965; Nicolae 2012, 2013), when the structure [past participle + suffixal article] had already become rare; as to nominal ellipsis and substantivization, the two articles gradually specialised their function, eliminating the ambiguity typical of ORom.',\n",

To compare KR theories, we establish quantitative acquisition-based metrics that assess learnability from realistic input data. We conduct a \\r\\nlearnability analysis for three KR theories proposed for metrical phonology and evaluate them on  English, a language that is notoriously irregular with respect to metrical phonology and therefore non-trivial to learn. We find that all three KRs have similar learnability potential, but the proposed English grammars within each theory are not the grammars able to account for the most English child input data, even if the learner has some knowledge of the interaction between English metrical phonology and morphology. This suggests learnability issues exist for the proposed English grammar in all three theories if a learner is attempting to learn a grammar that accounts for as much input data as possible. We discuss ways a learner may still be able to learn the English grammar from English input by incorporating (i) additional useful linguistic knowledge about English metrical phonology interactions and (ii) biases to selectively learn from the input. We additionally discuss which aspects of the proposed English grammars are hurting learnability, observing that small changes in parameter values or constraint-rankings lead to significantly better learnability results.\",\n",

       "  \"We argue that sign languages have a crucial role to play in the foundations of semantics, for two reasons. First, in some cases sign languages provide overt evidence on crucial aspects of the Logical Form of sentences,  ones that must be inferred indirectly in spoken language (= 'Logical Visibility'). Examples involve loci, which might sometimes be the overt realization of logical variables; and Role Shift, which may be the overt realization of context shift. Second, along one dimension sign languages are strictly more expressive than spoken languages because iconic phenomena can be found at their logical core (= 'Iconicity'). Thus loci may have a depictive component, and Role Shift has iconic effects as well.  From this perspective, spoken language semantics is along some dimensions a 'simplified' version of sign language semantics, one from which the iconic component has been mostly lost.  While one may conclude that the full extent of Universal Semantics can only be studied in sign languages, an alternative is that spoken languages have comparable expressive mechanisms, but only when co-speech gestures are taken into account – hence the need for a precise semantics for gestures as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: a far more detailed presentation can be found in 'Visible Meaning: Sign Language and the Foundations of Semantics', to appear in Theoretical Linguistics.\",\n",

This pat- tern is common across many processes cross-linguistically – but why are segmental processes at word edges often more variable, and what influences the rate of variability? We propose that phonological variability is only indirectly influenced by syntax and prosody through the locality of production planning (Production Planning Hypothesis, PPH), and test its predictions for English flapping in a corpus study and a production experiment. Previous literature on flapping showed that it is sensitive to syntactic structure (e.g. Kaisse (1985)), and to prosodic structure (e.g. Nespor and Vogel (1986)), but did not explain why it is constrained in this way, nor why these domain effects are variable. We discuss that these effects are expected under our hypothesis, as well as certain frequency effects, and are arguably not entirely reducible to the effect of gestural overlap, based on new experimental and corpus data.',\n",

Taking these feature bundles to be sets allows us to apply ideas from set theory to phonology. In this paper, we explore some of the theoretical consequences of using set-theory to represent underspecification.

By comparing sound-symbolic corpora with general lexicon corpora, this study shows that the sound-symbolic lexicons of three Sinitic varieties (Mandarin, Taiwanese Southern Min, Hong Kong Cantonese) are skewed so that the majority of sound-symbolic syllables are in high tone while the general lexicon is not. Building on the idea that gesture and eye movement facilitate word-learning, it is proposed that prosodic demarcation of descriptive and non-arbitrary words is analogous to a gesture in the speech stream which helps the listener (child) pinpoint its referent.

I argue that current developments in the theory of locality in Distributed Morphology (Embick 2010, Marantz 2013) impose boundaries on syntactic analysis and that morphemes cannot be identified and analyzed without studying their realization at the interfaces of syntax with both phonology and interpretation. The empirical focus is on a series of phenomena which are attested in Icelandic noun phrases and involve the realization of roots, category-defining heads, inflection morphemes, and definite articles, all of which may appear in the same noun as shown below. \\r\\n\\r\\n(1) leik-end-ur-nir ’play’-nmlz-m.nom.pl-def \\r\\n\\r\\nThree main components of the dissertation involve applicative structures, definite articles and morphophonology.

A study which compares definite articles in German and Icelandic supports the findings in Schwarz (2009) that there are two definite articles in natural language and the realization of the Icelandic articles has implications for the theory of suffixation under adjacency (Embick and Noyer 2001). These case studies, in addition to a series of smaller case studies, support the view that an analysis of one linguistic component may only be well-informed if it considers other interacting components as well. My method, to approach a well-defined empirical case, Icelandic nouns, with a precise theoretical framework like Distributed Morphology, yields valuable results. I show how many types of locality constraints interact in the same word and this is pleasing because it shows that the theory is not based on convenient but cross-linguistically isolated data sets. Rather, aspects of language like syntax, morphology and semantics are constantly interacting and they are best understood in the context of each other.',\n",

We first demonstrate that the simplest behavioral assumptions make it challenging to provide lexical specifications for A- and B-calls: B-calls rather clearly have the distribution of general alarm calls; but A-calls are also found in highly heterogeneous contexts (e.g. they are triggered by 'cat in the canopy' and 'raptor on the ground' situations). We discuss two possible solutions to the problem. One posits that entire sequences are endowed with meanings that are not compositionally derived from their individual parts (a related idea was proposed by Arnold and Zuberbühler to analyze pyow-hack sequences in Putty-nosed monkeys). The second analysis combines a very simple compositional analysis with some more sophisticated assumptions about the environmental context in which the calls are used; specifically, we argue that the B-call is a general alarm call, that the A-call is used for serious non-ground threats, and that they are combined by the simplest (conjunctive) rule; but their interaction with the context conspires to make it possible for call sequences to reflect information about predator nature and predator location.\",\n",

The majority of current approaches to VPE are tailored to derive this parallel binding requirement, ruling out mixed readings where one of the VPs involves a bound pronoun and the other a free pronoun in parallel positions. Contrary to this assumption, it is observed that there are cases of VPE where the antecedent VP contains a bound pronoun but the elided VP contains a free E-type pronoun anchored to the quantifier, in violation of parallel binding. We dub this the ‘sticky reading’ of VPE. To account for it, we propose a new identity condition on VPE which is less stringent than is standardly assumed.

Drawing on evidence from VP-ellipsis and focus constructions in English, I argue against the standard binding theory assumption that reflexives must be interpreted as bound variables only (such as in the binding theory of Chomsky (1981); Reinhart (1983); Büring (2005)). In both of these constructions, strict readings of reflexives are found to be acceptable. Based on this observation, I propose instead that reflexives, like non-reflexive pronouns, can be interpreted either as free variables, coreferential with their antecedents or as bound variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the motivation for coreferential reflexives established, this dissertation explores how Condition A can capture this interpretive option. I expand on a proposal of Sauerland (2013) in which Condition A is built into the compositional semantics as an argument identity presupposition, and that strict readings are analysed as an instance of weakened presupposition projection. I argue that this semantic approach to Condition A and strict readings is more insightful than a syntactic approach, such as Fiengo and May’s (1994) vehicle change analysis, since it is able to link the behaviour of reflexives to the already established empirical phenomenon of weakened projection.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, this dissertation is concerned with the conditions under which presuppositional elements can be absent in focus alternatives. In order for weakened projection to occur, Sauerland (2013) assumes that a presupposition must be purely presuppositional. I present data which are problematic for this assumption and outline a new direction for the conditions under which weakened projection in focus alternatives may proceed, which is based on the relation the presuppositional element bears to the focus-marked phrase.',\n",

       "  'Generative approaches to language have long recognized the natural link between theories of knowledge representation and theories of knowledge acquisition. The basic idea is that the knowledge representations provided by Universal Grammar enable children to acquire language as reliably as they do because these representations highlight the relevant aspects of the available linguistic data. So, one reasonable evaluation of any theory of representation is how useful it is for acquisition. This means that when we have multiple theories for how knowledge is represented, we can try to evaluate these theoretical options by seeing how children might use them during  acquisition. Computational models of the acquisition process are an effective tool for determining this, since they allow us to incorporate the assumptions of a representation into a cognitively plausible learning scenario and see what happens. We can then identify which representations work for acquisition, and what those representations need to work. This in turn allows us to refine both our theories of how knowledge is represented and how those representations are used by children during acquisition. I discuss two case studies of this approach for representations in metrical stress and syntax, and consider what we learn from this computational acquisition evaluation in each domain.',\n",

It is shown that there is an extremely close match between theoretically derived expectations for clusters made up of auxiliaries, modals, causative `let', a main verb, and verbal particles.

Such claims raise questions about the degree to which identity conditions on ellipsis are sensitive to syntax. This paper reviews the literature on non-isomorphic sluices, presents new evidence for such cases, and concludes that identity conditions in sluicing must, at least, be blind to syntactic differences between copular Wh-questions and their non-copular antecedents. An important challenge to such a view comes from case-matching effects in sluicing (Ross 1969). Copular Wh-arguments in sluices, in many languages and contexts, differ in case from their antecedent correlates. Given case-matching, we expect such sluices to be unacceptable. I show that an empirically motivated characterization of case-matching is compatible with a view that allows (non-isomorphic) sluiced copular clauses. In short, abstract Case is irrelevant in sluicing, and instead, morphological case is what matters. In languages that mark case on remnants, case must match with the correlate (e.g., German, Russian, Greek), but in languages that do not (e.g. Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish), abstract Case need not match. One consequence, is that ellipsis of copular clauses is available in many instances, and not others, with cross-linguistic consequences about when and where we expect non-isomorphic copular sluices to be available.',\n",

       "  'Summary:\\r\\nAre there alternate paths to explanatory theories beyond Chomksy’s programmatic axioms and architecture of linguistic competence? We propose and motivate Tool Grammar, in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts.  A revision of  the architecture of competence shifting away from the strict centrality of syntax in the can increase the potential for explanatory power in the generative program.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo test the thesis we select from among difficult and vexing problems in syntactic theory. We present and defend empirically transparent and radically penetrating mechanisms for these problems while rigorously constraining the notion of a human language in support of the primary Chomskyan goal of explaining infinite linguistic creativity from finite resources and rapid child language learning in the context of poverty of stimulus data.  We conclude that syntactic theory requires specification of structural intent in order properly to solve a set of the most difficult theoretical challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguage has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.    Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A vast swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. When syntactic phenomena are understood to be conditioned by linguistic action/intent descriptors, difficult problems yield to straightforward solutions: conflicting intents yield ill-formed sentences. When generalizations are sought at an incorrect and incapable level of representation, unnatural and unnecessarily contrived solutions unavoidably result.  By incorporating intention action directives into linguistic structure building, syntactic problems generally acquire a facilitative pragmatic resolution: much of syntax is transformed into utilitarian cognitive pragmatics.    Important fundamentals of syntax are reducible to a particular form of cognitive pragmatics and syntax is no longer so autonomous a component of linguistic competence.   Much of the Chomskyan Weltanshaung and the resulting theories can be retained and revalidated, but much also is to be gained by refactoring the work product of linguistic science.\\r\\n\\r\\nTG represents a sub-paradigmatic shift in syntactic theory to the extent it can be integrated to the generative program.  Important Chomskyan tenets are revised but significant elements are retained. Poverty of stimulus, universals, ill-formedness, recursiveness, interpretation, generative capacity, filtering, and so forth are reinterpreted in an alternative architecture of linguistic competence.  Our arguments are launched by considering a range of critical issues in theoretical syntax plus a set of difficult unresolved problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl visited the sick woman.\\r\\nThe sick woman was visited by Al.\\r\\nWhat was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.\\r\\n*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe observe incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is a tip-of-the-iceberg example of issues that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  This paper presents a range of arguments from linguistic and poetic data that action intents are of the essence in a set of syntactic processes.  When the intentions underlying structural decisions are examined, separate from the internals of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, all three maybe simplified, potentially increasing the constraints on what it is to be a human language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operative hypotheses of this paper include whether linguistic rules must include linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has not heretofore been fully examined. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we demonstrate that optimal linguistic theory is inclined toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  We present a set of problems in linguistic theory that require the dimension of structural intent for fully empirical solutions to emerge given that intentions are undeniable in the epistemology of language.  The absence of this level of representation in syntactic theory is seen to account for difficulties in advancing the theory in linear progress toward more comprehensive coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe conclude that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactual complexity and undesirably precludes the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more naturalistic solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax. \\r\\n\\r\\n.',\n",

Regardless of whether this strong statement is true of human languages or not, it seems clear that the empirical status of phonological opacity needs to reexamined. In this theoretical context, this paper (i) offers a catalogue of cases of phonological opacity found in Japanese and (ii) provides information about how likely each case is to be treated as a productive pattern in the synchronic phonology of Japanese. This paper generally does not attempt to argue for a definitive answer for each case, but instead provides information that can be used to argue for or against its productivity, so that each researcher can evaluate the likelihood of the synchronic reality of each opaque pattern. Nevertheless, the overall emerging conclusion is that there are no cases of opacity in Japanese, which can be considered to be productive and psychologically real without a doubt.

Our central theoretical claim is that the countability layer is implemented as a (pseudo-)classifier structure whose morphological manifestation obeys a principle of syntactic “visibility”. Our specific claim for Russian is that, diachronically, the countability layer has emerged as a result of the loss of the dual number in the course of transition between Old and Modern Russian.

In Latin null subjects are permitted and occur in all of these contexts without restriction. The omitted subjects in the Lindisfarne gloss thus seem to represent a genuine (Northumbrian) Old English syntactic possibility; support for this conclusion is drawn from a new quantitative study of the Gospel of John.

       "  \"Bantu languages, which are spoken throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, permit wh-questions to be constructed in multiple ways, including wh-in-situ, full wh-movement, and partial wh-movement. Shona, a Bantu language spoken by about 13 million people in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, allows all three of these types. In this dissertation, I conduct the first in-depth examination of Shona wh-questions, drawing on fifty hours of elicitation with a native speaker consultant to explore the derivational relationships among these strategies.\\r\\n \\r\\nWh-in-situ questions have received a wide variety of treatments in the syntactic literature, ranging from covert or disguised movement to postsyntactic binding of the wh-phrase by a silent question operator. In Bantu languages, wh-in-situ questions are often taken to be derived via a non-movement relation (e.g., Carstens 2005 for Kilega, Diercks 2010 for Lubukusu, Muriungi 2003 for Kîîtharaka, Sabel 2000 for Kikuyu and Duala, Sabel & Zeller 2006 for Zulu, Schneider-Zioga 2007 for Kinande), but alternatives have rarely been considered. I demonstrate how movement-based analyses that have been proposed for wh-in-situ in non-Bantu languages make the wrong predictions for Shona wh-in-situ, which lacks word order permutation, extraction marking, island effects, and intervention effects. These properties provide support for the traditional Bantuist view that the relation between the pronunciation site of an in-situ wh-phrase and its scopal position in the left periphery is not movement; I claim that in Shona it is unselective binding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Bantu languages, including Shona, prohibit wh-phrases from appearing in the canonical preverbal subject position. Wasike (2007) demonstrates that this restriction applies to topicalized non-subjects as well as preverbal subjects. I replicate these results for Shona and argue that they cast doubt on Sabel & Zeller's (2006) attempt to characterize the ban with an appeal to improper movement. I argue instead that restrictions on the distribution of wh-in-situ in Bantu are tied to restrictions on the domain for focus licensing. This claim is further bolstered by an examination of crosslinguistic variation within Bantu with respect to whether the ban on in-situ preverbal wh-subjects applies in embedded clauses. I observe a previously unnoticed generalization: languages that universally ban in-situ preverbal wh-subjects (like Zulu) have immediately after the verb (IAV) focus effects; languages that do allow in-situ preverbal wh-subjects in embedded clauses (like Shona, Lubukusu, and Kîîtharaka) also lack IAV effects.\\r\\n \\r\\nFull wh-movement in Shona gives rise to questions that bear a certain similarity to English wh-questions. However, using a range of diagnostics including extraction marking, island effects, reconstruction effects, and the distribution of temporal modifiers, I argue that what appears to be full wh-movement in Shona actually has a cleft structure: the wh-phrase moves to become the head of a relative clause, which is selected by a copula in the matrix clause. Just as in wh-in-situ, an ex-situ wh-phrase is pronounced lower than its scopal position, and the relation between these two positions is established via unselective binding. Additional evidence for this proposal comes from the sensitivity of partial wh-movement to island boundaries below but not above the pronunciation site of the wh-phrase, a pattern that has been predicted by previous analyses (e.g., Abels 2012, Sabel 2000, Sabel & Zeller 2006) but for which empirical support has been lacking until now. I therefore unify full and partial wh-movement under a single analysis for cleft-based wh-ex-situ that involves a step of relativization (independently needed for relative clauses) and a step of unselective binding (independently needed for wh-in-situ).\",\n",

       "  \"This paper is concerned with the syntax and morphology of A'-extraction effects in the Niger-Congo language Wolof, and what they can tell us about well known properties of A'-movement - cyclicity and locality. Wolof exhibits three different A'-extraction effects: morphological marking of the cyclicity of movement, agreement in class between the wh-complementizer and the extracted phrase, and a subject/non-subject asymmetry, akin to the that-trace effect. The analysis developed here aims to show that agreement lies at the center of all A′-extraction effects, and that their surface morpho-syntactic properties can at least partly be understood as resulting from the general mechanisms underlying the operation Agree, such as the presence of particular uninterpretable features and their location. Wolof is particularly suitable for the exploration of not only the morpho-synatax of A'-movement, but also the interaction of various A'-extraction effects. All the aforementioned effects in Wolof surface on C, and their interaction triggers allomorphy of the complementizer. The novelty of the approach advocated in this paper is in maintaining a unified syntax for different types of A′-movement structures, and providing a realizational analysis in the framework of Distributed Morphology, which attributes the surface differences in the CP layer in Wolof to post-syntactic conditions on feature co-occurrence, known to exist in many languages.\",\n",

The auxiliary is in most sentences enclitic on the participle, but in certain contexts it can cliticize on other items as well, located at a distance from it. In these cases, the auxiliary may end up in a position not adjacent to the participle at all, on the left of its normal cliticization site. \\r\\nThe analysis of the contexts allowing this peculiar order sheds light on the syntactic properties of MEA. We show that when the auxiliary is cliticized on something other than the participle, it obligatorily signals that the phrase in question is either a contrastive focus or an interrogative element. We argue that these structures are instances of a very well-known phenomenon concerning word order, namely Verb Second – henceforth V2. V2 is a property of several languages around the world, such as for instance Germanic languages and some Indo-Aryan languages, such as Kashmiri.  We compare MEA with German and English on one side, and Kashmiri on the other, and show that MEA is an intermediate case, realizing properties of both types of languages. In particular, we argue that in MEA, as in Kashmiri, and to a lesser extent in English, V2 is sensitive to the information structure of the sentence, namely to the distinction between given and new information.',\n",

The term “ergativity” has been most commonly used to refer to systems with one or both of the following properties: (i) transitive subjects pattern differently from intransitive subjects and from transitive objects; and (ii) transitive objects and intransitive subjects pattern alike. A wide range of work across different traditions converges on the idea that “ergativity” is not a single unitary phenomenon, and is not realized in the same way across different languages. Dixon (1994, 219), for example suggests that “there is no necessary connection between ergative characteristics and any other linguistic feature”, and Johns (2000, 67) writes in a similar vein that there may be “little value in studying ergativity as a thing in itself.” In her recent survey of ergativity, Deal (2015b) suggests that “ergativity is not one but many phenomena.” Nonetheless, certain patterns and correlations emerge, suggesting that while there is certainly diversity, there is also some unity––perhaps motivating the existence of this additional volume on the topic. The general themes of unity and diversity in and among ergative systems are touched on in the chapters that follow.',\n",

In simple cases, an antecedent is associated with a position or 'locus' in signing space, and an anaphoric link is obtained by pointing towards that locus to recover its semantic value. It has been argued that this mechanism is sometimes an overt realization of the device of coindexation in formal syntax and semantics. Summarizing some recent semantic work, we discuss two kinds of insights that sign language research can bring to the foundations of anaphora. First, in some cases the overt nature of indices in sign language makes it possible to bring overt evidence to bear on classic debates in semantics. We consider two: the first concerns the availability of situation-denoting variables in natural language (we argue that pointing signs can be situation-denoting in addition to being object-denoting); the other concerns the availability of binding without c-command (we suggest that sign language provides overt evidence for such a possibility). Second, in some cases sign language pronouns raise new challenges for formal semantics. In a nutshell, the challenge is that loci may simultaneously function as formal variables and as simplified depictions of what they denote – which requires the construction of a formal semantics with iconicity to analyze their properties.\",\n",

The procedure for root identification assumed by those proposals thus involves only pairwise examination of verbal stems, disregarding both stems of other lexical categories and verbal stems outside the transitivity pair.  Relaxation of these constraints, which have no principled basis, reveals that a significant minority of Japanese verb stems in fact display sequences of two transitivity-determining suffixes (yuru- ‘slack (adj.)’, yuru-m- ‘slacken (intr.)’, yuru-m-e- ‘slacken (tr.)’; nezi ‘screw’, nezi-r- ‘twist (tr.)’, nezi-r-e- ‘get twisted’).  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe recognition of sequences of transitivity-determining suffixes allows us to test the hypothesis that those suffixes are syntactic elements by examining how they interact with each other.  When this is done, we find that, in sharp contrast to what is observed with uncontroversially syntactic elements like auxiliary verbs, an outer transitivity suffix must be taken to render an inner one inert for purposes of semantic interpretation and argument structure.  A parallel argument is provided by the interaction of the verbal suffix -m- and the adjectival suffix -si-:  voiding of the properties of the inner element is again observed, along with the added complication that the order in which those two suffixes occur is an idiosyncratic function of the individual root.  A final argument against taking the combination of root and transitivity suffix to be a syntactic construction is the diachronic instability of the putatively compositional interpretation thereof; I consider in particular the case of causative -s-.

Two classes of environments are discussed where such restrictions are observed, namely, complements of speech act verbs in their non-agentive uses and complements of nouns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to account for the observed restrictions, this dissertation argues that clausal complements in Russian project a DP-layer and thus are subject to the Case requirement, just like nominal complements. Consequently, clausal complements must appear in Case positions, in contrast to the standardly held view. It is proposed that in apparent “Caseless” positions clausal complements are licensed by a null preposition, which has licensing conditions related to its semantic interpretation (as a two-place relation between a proposition and its “utterer”/“holder”).  As a result, the observed restrictions on clausal complements in Russian follow from the Case requirement of clausal complements coupled with the licensing conditions on the null preposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dissertation is of relevance to researchers working on the syntax and semantic of clausal complements, Case and the grammar of Slavic languages.',\n",

In some languages where gaps and resumptives are in complementary distribution, the choice between the two strategies depends on the Case of the head noun: in Swiss German, the focus of our study, dative relativization requires resumptives; however, the resumptive is omitted if the head noun bears\\r\\ndative as well. This non-local dependency poses an serious challenge to local derivational bottom-up theories of syntax. We argue that a local solution is possible if the distribution of resumption is reinterpreted in terms of Case attraction and the derivation unfolds top-down. Consequently, the relevant piece of information, the Case of the head noun, is available on the operator so that the choice between gaps and resumptives can be made without recourse to non-local devices. Gap relatives obtain in conﬁgurations where the Case attraction derivation converges while resumptives occur as a repair in derivations where Case attraction leaves a Case-probe unchecked. The matching effect falls out naturally as a subcase of Case attraction.',\n",

       "  'The goal of this paper is to present evidence from Brazilian Portuguese (BP), German, Italian, and Tamil for a hitherto unobserved species of obligatory control (OC) that obtains only in the scope of deontic modality, which we term \"proxy control\". Formally, proxy control involves a non-exhaustive obligatory control relation between one set of individuals i and another, f (i), that is discourse-contextually related to it. It thus bears a clear connection to proxy readings reported in the realm of anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Lidz 2004 Reuland and Winter 2009) though the nature of the proxy relationship is fundamentally different in both. We show, furthermore, that the environments that license proxy control are a proper subset of those that license partial control, another non-exhaustive obligatory control dependency. A central question that arises with respect to non-exhaustive control dependencies like partial and proxy control, given that these are discourse-contextually conditioned, is whether their treatment should be relegated entirely to (LF-)semantics or to discourse-pragmatics. Here, we provide novel evidence showing that proxy control can feed phi-agreement on floating quantifiers and secondary predicates in Brazilian Portuguese and Italian to argue that part of the proxy control dependency must be (morpho-)syntactically instantiated. The theoretical implications of these findings are potentially far-reaching. In addition to widening the typology of possible obligatory control dependencies in natural language, proxy control also poses a strong challenge to movement theories of control (e.g. involving a null comitative PP containing the controller in the controlled constituent, as in Boeckx et al. 2010, a.o.). We propose a preliminary analysis of the proxy control facts in terms of Landau (2015b)’s “logophoric” control, suggesting in particular that the mediating perspectival C head in the control complement encodes a species of deontic modal (Mod_deontic): this captures the property that proxy control only obtains in the scope of deontic modality, just as desired.',\n",

These verb alternations may be correlated with the dialectal presence of the clitic se. Verb classes that exhibit this alternation are typically motion verbs such as caer ‘fall’ and entrar ‘go.in’ and change of state verbs like explotar ‘explode’. \\u200b\\r\\nAccording to De Miguel (1999), aspectual se is accepted by motion unaccusatives such as ir 'go' when they denote the event’s initial endpoint, since the initial endpoint (e.g., the origin) is unspecified. Similarly, a verb such as entrar 'go in' would not allow se because it denotes the event’s terminal endpoint while leaving the initial endpoint unspecified. We claim that the verbs under study exhibit extended syntactic frames in Non-Standard varieties that make them compatible with either theme arguments (see e.g., Harley 2011), interpreted as results of change-of-state roots, or goals in the case of motion (change-of-position) roots. The final composition of verbal root plus complement triggers the interpretation of the resulting structure as a complex achievement rather than a simple achievement, licensing an external Causer, which in Spanish may be syntactically realized as se if the argument is morphologically underspecified. The most salient semantic contrast between a complex and a simple achievement has to do with the interpretation of the event as no longer denoting a mere culmination but rather a full change of state or position.\",\n",

While Set Merge is contingent on the feature specifications of the heads of the two merging elements, the Merge Condition on Adjuncts states that an adjunct must merge in accordance with the feature specifications of its own head. Two edge features are available: [+ Predicational] and [- Predicational]. Only the former forces the adjunct to function as an open predicate and to establish a predication dependency – or a subject-predicate relation – with an element in the matrix clause. This requirement is syntactic, and it overrides the semantic specifications of adjuncts. Support comes from adjunct control into circumstantial clauses in Lebanese Arabic.',\n",

We review the problems caused by the lack of positive criteria for morphomicity and by disagreements over the application of negative criteria. We present arguments for a learning bias in favour of realization patterns involving natural classes, and we call for greater use of wug-tests and artificial grammar learning experiments in research on this question. Competing morphological theories turn out to be exhibit a surprising amount of empirical overlap, and their implications for the learnability of morphomic patterns are less straightforward than usually assumed.',\n",

This new methodology enables a more quantitative approach to the study of accents. Studies on spoken dialect data have shown that a combination of representativeness (the difference between pronunciations within the language variety is small) and distinctiveness (the difference between pronunciations inside and outside the variety is large) is a good way to identify characteristic features of a language variety. We applied this method from dialectology to transcriptions of the words from the Speech Accent Archive, while treating L2 English speakers with different L1s as 'varieties'. This yields lists of words that are pronounced characteristically differently in comparison to native accents of English. We discuss English accent characteristics for French, Hungarian and Dutch. We compare the French and Hungarian results to phonological descriptions of those languages to identify the source of the difference. The Dutch results are compared to a Dutch accents judgement study to evaluate the measure. Knowing about these characteristic features of accents has useful applications in teaching L2 learners of English, since potentially difficult sounds or sound combinations can be identified and addressed based on the learner's native language.\",\n",

I claim that the pre-verbal associate in transitive existentials raises to the edge of the progressive aspectual layer and therefore does not intervene for the purposes of progressive and passive inflections, but does so for higher inflections. In unaccusative existential constructions the associate remains in post-verbal position and so does not intervene for any type of inflection. This analysis is shown to have potentially far reaching repercussions cross-linguistically. Finally, I explain the distribution of the English associate by claiming the associate is stranded on the edge of the clause internal phase, and appeal to the dynamic approach to phases to motivate the various positions the associate occupies.',\n",

Section 1, on finite complementizers, shows that Aromanian supports analyses of complementizers as wh- pronouns independently developed for other Romance languages. Section 2 elaborates a proposal originally put forth for Albanian, where the subjunctive particle is identical to the Linker – namely that the main role of subjunctive particles is introducing a variable EPP argument, subject to control. Section 3 argues that the impossibility of embedding sentences directly under V-v (a sort of ‘Agree Resistance Principle’) leads to the overall shape of complementation in Romance, determining the obliquization strategy represented by Prepositional introducers of non-finite sentences – as well as to the nominalization (relativization) strategy of section 1.',\n",

The results show that the data are consistent with the proposed major place of articulation markedness hierarchies by Lombardi (2002) and de Lacy (2005, 2006). The unpermitted coda consonants surface as glottals, which have the least marked place of articulation. However, when the realization of glottals is blocked by a high-ranking faithfulness constraint, coronals surface. Moreover, alveolar affricates surface as post alveolar fricatives, contrary to the claim that [+anterior] is universally less marked than [-anterior]. Based on the evidence from Azeri, Pali, Indonesian, and European Portuguese, we show that there is no universal markedness relationship between [-anterior] and [+anterior].',\n",

The other series combines a wh-word with the same EVEN particle, and may appear with or without the numeral ‘one.’ We discuss the relation of these NPIs to indefinite expressions in Dharamsala Tibetan, and document their syntactic licensing conditions. We show that NPIs are licensed in the scope of a clause-mate negation and in questions, but not in other downward-entailing environments.\\r\\n\\r\\n|\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then present a compositional semantics for these two types of NPIs which explains their negative-polarity dependency, based on Lahiri’s (1998) analysis of similar constructions in Hindi.

Allowing the additive component of EVEN to scope independently of the scalar part, the additive part of EVEN is used to generate an indefinite out of the wh-word. The scalar component will be used to ensure that EVEN-NPIs can only be used in downward entailing contexts.',\n",

       "  \"This paper investigates the use of possessive morphosyntax to express modal necessity, as in the English use of |. We claim that possessive modality constructions arise because both possession and necessity express a relation of inclusion between two arguments of the same semantic type: possession involves a relation of inclusion between two <e>-type arguments, while necessity involves inclusion between sets of worlds. Differences between the two arise from their different syntax: possessive | expresses possession via syntactic transitivity, while modals conceal one argument within the modal head. The similarities and differences are captured within a realizational approach to morphology, in which vocabulary items like | are inserted to spell out structures consisting of formal features. The proposal is then extended from |-possession languages, focusing on possessive modality in Hindi-Urdu and Bengali. We argue that the possessive/modal head can be ``applicative-like,'' licensing oblique case on an argument that raises to its specifier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account explains why possessive morphosyntax uniformly is used to express modal necessity, and not other modal meanings: the universal force of elements like | follows from the inclusion relation expressed by possession. Possessive modality thus sheds light not only on the semantics of possession but also on the compositional syntax of modal operators.\",\n",

I also argue against an adverb analysis of Romanian tough-words and against a subject analysis of the clausal argument of the tough-word. I propose a novel analysis, which is supported by West Germanic data: non-agreeing TCs are multi-headed constituents, in which the adjective is the internal head, selecting the supine CP, and the supine C is the external head. Since the adjective is not the external head, it cannot take part in agreement relations involving the [Adjective+Supine] constituent. I provide a technical implementation of the notion of multi-headed constituents which relies on Citko’s (2008) flexible label projection: in this case, it is the label of the complement that projects (an instance of Project-Goal). Finally, I discuss the correlation between the availability of multi-headed TCs and the morphological (in)distinctness between adjectives and adverbs.',\n",

Its aim is to gather evidence on whether basic word order is predictive of further properties of a language. The languages under investigation are the Finno-Ugric languages Udmurt (as an OV language) and Finnish (as a VO language). Counter to Kayne (1994), Haider proposes that the structure of a sentence with a head-final VP is fundamentally different from that of a sentence with a head-initial VP, e.g., OV languages do not exhibit a VP-shell structure, and they do not employ a TP layer with a structural subject position. Haider's proposed structural differences are said to result in the following empirically testable differences:\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) VP: the availability of VP-internal adverbial intervention and scrambling only in OV-VPs;\\r\\n(b) subjects: the lack of certain subject-object asymmetries in OV languages, i.e., lack of the subject condition and lack of superiority effects;\\r\\n(c) V-complexes: the availability of partial predicate fronting only in OV languages; different orderings between selecting and selected verbs; the intervention of non-verbal material between verbs only in VO languages;\\r\\n(d) V-particles: differences in the distribution of resultative phrases and verb particles.\\r\\n\\r\\nUdmurt and Finnish behave in line with Haider's predictions with regard to the status of the subject, with regard to the order of selecting and selected verbs, and with regard to the availability of partial predicate fronting. Moreover, Udmurt allows for adverbial intervention and scrambling, as predicted, whereas the status of these properties in Finnish could not be reliably determined due to obligatory V-to-T. There is also counterevidence to Haider's predictions: Udmurt allows for non-verbal material between verbs, and the distribution of resultative phrases and verb particles is essentially as free as the distribution of adverbial phrases in both Finno-Ugric languages. As such, Haider's theory is not falsified by the data from Udmurt and Finnish (except for his theory on verb particles), but it is also not fully supported by the data.\\r\\n\\r\\nReaders are welcome to e-mail criticism and suggestions on how to improve the diagnostics and on further possible criteria (e.g., which further properties would follow from the lack of the EPP/SpecTP)!\",\n",

       "  'This thesis develops and tests a unified model of word-level prosodic contrasts. Traditionally, word prosody has been analyzed within disparate models (such as autosegmental theory for tone, metrical theory for stress, and CV, X-slot, or moraic theory for length), meaning that it has not been possible to make clear predictions about how many different prosodic features can be employed in a single language.\\r\\n\\r\\nI present a minimal architecture for word prosodic representations based on a single set of formal elements. A tier of segmental root nodes, or X-slots, bears the binary contrastive features that divide the segmental inventory and represents quantity contrasts through two-to-one linking, while a tier of prosodic root nodes, or \"pi-nodes\", bears the binary features dividing the autosegmental inventory. Features on pi-nodes are used in tone languages with more than one tonal autosegment, but in privative tone languages, the pi-node itself reflects the phonetic realization of the marked member of the tone opposition. The same featureless pi-node is used as an autosegmental marker of accented positions in lexical stress systems, where its language-specific phonetic realization is that of stress: some combination of increased pitch, duration, and intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predictive power of this model is that it restricts systems to a maximum of two independent word prosodic contrasts, since each requires its own tier of root nodes. The pi-tier can represent either tone or accent separately from length on the X-tier, but this leaves no means to represent a third contrast. In certain systems, surface stress may be represented covertly as length on the X-tier with tone represented on the pi-tier, but no mechanism is available to host a third contrast, since the X-tier is already used for stress.',\n",

       "  'Ditransitive predicates select for two internal arguments, and hence minimally entail the participation of three entities in the event described by the verb. Canonical ditranstive verbs include give, show and teach; in each case, the verb requires an Agent (a giver, shower or teacher, respectively), a Theme (the thing given, shown or taught) and a Goal (the recipient, viewer, or student). The property of requiring two internal arguments makes ditransitive verbs syntactically unique. Selection in generative grammar is often modelled as syntactic sisterhood, so ditranstive verbs immediately raise the question of whether a verb might have two sisters, requiring a ternary-branching structure, or whether one of the two internal arguments is not in a sisterhood relation with the verb.\\r\\nAnother important property of English ditransitive constructions is the two syntactic structures associated with them. In the so-called “Double Object Construction”, or DOC, the Goal and Theme both are simple NPs and appear following the verb in the order V-Goal-Theme. In the Dative construction”, the Goal is a PP, rather than an NP, and follows the Theme, in the order V-Theme-to Goal. Many ditransitive verbs allow both structures (e.g. give John a book/give a book to John). Some verbs are restricted to appear only in one or the other (e.g. demonstrate a technique to the class/*demonstrate the class a technique; cost John $20/*cost $20 to John). For verbs which allow both structures, there can be slightly different interpretations available for each. The detailed analysis of these questions has led to considerable progress in generative syntax. For example, the discovery of the hierarchical relationship between the first and second arguments of a ditransitive have been key in motivating the adoption of binary branching and the vP hypothesis. Many outstanding questions remain, however, and the syntactic encoding of ditransitivity continues to inform the development of grammatical theory.',\n",

Evidence for this account comes from a process called Suspended Afﬁxation. This process is known to delete the right edges of non-ﬁnal conjuncts under recoverability. We show however, that Suspended Afﬁxation in Mari does not apply to the right edges of surface orders. Rather, the right edges of an inter-\\r\\nmediate postsyntactic representation are relevant.

In this paper, working in the context of a general model of the inferential relation between synchrony and diachrony in inflectional morphophonology, I compute the predictions for potential change for three analyses of those alternations and show that only one set of predictions is consistent with the ongoing changes evident in a nationwide survey of inflection.  I conclude that the analysis generating the correct predictions is the unique descriptively adequate analysis of the system of alternations in question.  With regard to the explanatory principles governing the choice of that analysis from the set of observationally adequate alternatives, I show that the Japanese case counterexemplifies a wide range of proposals that have been made about the operation of morphophonological analysis and change and propose that the choice of both base forms and rules is due to a principle of Generalized Type Frequency.  Among the general themes of the paper are the grammatical reality of language-specific phonological rules, the relevance of analogical processes to synchronic description and explanation, and the limited role played in morphophonological analysis by global considerations of predictability.

It is found that Shuri combines two characteristics that make it particularly revealing as evidence for the r-Epenthesis analysis.  First, with respect to primary vowel-stems, Shuri illustrates the logical endpoint of the changes entailed by that analysis, namely the total assimilation of vowel-stem inflection to the inflectional pattern of r-stems.  Second, because of the creation of secondary vowel stems from historical w-stems and the ongoing nature of the assimilation of those vowel-stems to r-stem inflection, it displays evidence at the same time for r-Epenthesis as a living process that is still being extended.  When we broaden the focus from Shuri to Ryukyuan and to Japonic as a whole, we find that, with regard to the initiation of changes that lead in the direction of assimilation of vowel-stem to r-stem inflection, the area from northern Kyushu to southern Okinawa constitutes a dialect continuum straddling the Japanese-Ryukyuan boundary within which, to a first approximation, those changes are further advanced the further south one proceeds.',\n",

Previous work (Dillon et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2005; Liu, 2009; Li & Zhou, 2010; cf. Chen et al., 2012) has suggested that comprehenders initially evaluate the fit between the morphologically simple long-distance reflexive 'ziji' and the closest available subject position, only subsequently considering more structurally distant antecedents. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that this locality bias is the result of relatively poor cues to antecedent retrieval associated with the morphologically simple reflexive ziji. This predicts that the locality bias effect should be attenuated for anaphors with richer feature content that may serve as retrieval cues. In Experiment 1, we investigate the processing of ziji and show a strong locality bias for ziji in self-paced reading measures. In Experiment 2, we investigate the processing of the morphologically complex reflexive ta-ziji (lit. s/he-self) in the same structural configurations as Experiment 1. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that ta-ziji is not subject to the same locality bias effects in reading that ziji is. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the relatively impoverished feature content of ziji effectively forces comprehenders to adopt a search strategy to find an appropriate antecedent, resulting in locality bias effects in real-time processing measures. In contrast, relatively feature-rich anaphors like 'ta-ziji' show behavior more consistent with a direct-access antecedent retrieval mechanism, and relatively minimal locality bias effects in reading measures. Our conclusions are in line with other cross-linguistic research that suggests that the morphological features of an anaphoric expression influence how comprehenders retrieve an antecedent from working memory (Jäger et al, 2015).\",\n",

Taking neuter gender in Serbo-Croatian as the absence of gender (Kramer 2009), it is analyzed as a class of nouns which do not morpho-syntactically express the restriction over the unit of counting. In the domain of count nouns, the combination with count semantics yields nouns with non-uniform atomicity. Neuter count nouns are thus argued to be nouns which fail to formally express uniform atomicity, which makes them quantized\\r\\ncounterparts of collective nouns (i.e. quantized, non-uniformly atomic). While the nonuniform atomicity does not affect their singular forms, it is argued that neuter nouns in SC are unable to derive proper plural forms, and that productively derived collective forms are used instead. In other words, all neuter nouns in SC effectively have the status of singulatives – in the sense that they are expressions which refer to singularities and establish contrast in grammatical number with collective rather than with plural forms. A range of puzzling empirical phenomena related to neuter nouns is shown to be straightforwardly resolved by this view of the semantic effects of the absence of gender.\\r\\nThe paper also includes a discussion of Serbo-Croatian collective nouns, showing that their behavior in respect of number agreement triggered on the finite verb and licensing of reciprocal interpretations are determined by whether they are derived from an existing singular base, and whether they remain within its paradigms. Traditional neuter plurals, argued in this paper to be collectives, are shown to pattern in this respect with the collectives braća ‘brother.Coll’ and deca ‘child.Coll’, as they all belong to the paradigm of their singular bases, and as expected they all require plural agreement on the verb and license reciprocal predicates.',\n",

Although it has been more or less standardly assumed that Japanese null arguments are empty pronouns, recent literature has shown that they can be also derived via argument ellipsis based on the fact that they can yield readings that pronouns generally cannot support (Oku 1998; Saito 2007; Takahashi 2008a, b, among others). Most of the literature on argument ellipsis has discussed its availability, paying less attention to the issue under what conditions ellipsis of arguments is possible. This article focuses on this issue. Specifically, building on Abe’s (2009) observation that argument ellipsis is not freely available, I argue that argument ellipsis is locally phase-constrained (cf. Chomsky 2000, 2001, and seq.), developing a particular phase-based approach to argument ellipsis which is shown to have consequences for Abe’s (2009) anti-c-command generalization regarding the availability of argument ellipsis and Takahashi’s (1996a, b) “Antecedent-Contained Deletion” in Japanese. The approach developed in this article thus provides a tool which contributes to our understanding of the context in which the ellipsis-indicating readings are/are not available with Japanese null arguments.',\n",

       "  'This article discusses the morphosyntax of accusative subject constructions in Icelandic, from the point of view of the ‘dependent case’ analysis of accusative. The primary focus is on deriving the Accusative Subject Generalization (ASG), the generalization that accusative subjects are never related thematically to a morphologically intransitive verb. After it is demonstrated that the ASG holds, it is proposed that the ASG follows from the claim that there is no such thing as inherently case-marked accusatives in Icelandic. The accusative subject constructions under scrutiny in fact involve a silent external argument that distributes like a clitic syntactically and is interpreted like a weather pronoun semantically. The account is explanatory insofar as it involves one stipulation—the presence of a silent clitic—from which the ASG and numerous other syntactic, semantic, and morphological properties of accusative subject constructions follow. The explanatory value of the account hinges on a grammatical architecture where morphological idiosyncrasy and semantic idiosyncrasy are computed in distinct components of the grammar, and case marking—even structural case marking—is divorced from DP licensing.',\n",

       "  'There are generally two views of how language emerged in evolution: emergent and gradual. The emergent view holds that language appeared relatively rapidly within the last 100,000 years, possibly due to some minor mutation. The gradualist view postulates stages of \"protolanguage\" that began as a simple system that progressively developed into ever-complex systems until language as we know it emerged. The original protolanguage may have been singing, as Darwin conjectured, or lexical in nature as proposed by a number of linguists. Human language is enormously rich and complex, which makes it difficult to imagine that all the components of it emerged somehow out of the blue in recent evolutionary time, yet there is no evidence for such a system earlier in evolution. The Integration Hypothesis holds that language is an integration of two independently occurring systems in nature that underlie communication. One system, exemplified by the alarm calls of primates, is the Lexical system, which is composed of isolated units of utterance that typically have a specific referent, such as \"leopard,\" \"snake,\" and \"eagle\" as we see in the calls of Vervet monkeys. The Expression system, associated with birdsong, creates patterns without use of lexical items. Each system developed over a long span of time, millions, and possibly hundreds of millions of years. At some point in recent evolutionary time, the two systems, L and E, integrated uniquely in humans to give rise to language, which gives the appearance of rapid emergence.',\n",

The paper first briefly surveys backward control and how it has been accounted for in the literature. Section 2 brings theoretical background and looks closer at the mechanisms that are typically used in theoretical analysis of control and raising, namely movement/identity and coindexation. Section 3 describes some basic facts about Greek and Latin participles and gives some background on word order, which is crucial to the analysis. Since there is no case assignment in the lower (adjunct) clause, my analysis of the controller’s position relies crucially on word order facts. Section 4 offers a corpus study corroborating the principle of clause-bound discontinuity: word order is not so free as to allow scrambling across clauses, including adjunct participle clauses. Section 5 provides an analysis of the Greek and Latin data within Lexical-Functional Grammar and discusses the distribution of backward and forward control. Section 6 gives conclusions.',\n",

Working in the frameworks of Nanosyntax and Strict CV, I argue that syntax to prosody mapping is direct to the extent that prosodic domains correspond to particular syntactic constituents. On the basis of two vocalic alternations, namely vowel zero alternations in verbal prefixes and roots and alternations in vowel length in roots and theme suffixes, I show that the perfective verbal stem represented by a linear string prefix root theme is parsed into three prosodic constituents, [prefix root], [root theme] and [prefix root theme]. These prosodic domains correspond to three syntactic constituents: VP and a lower and higher projection of the theme suffix respectively. The crucial point of the syntactic analysis is that the prefix undergoes phrasal movement: it is generated next to the root in VP and when the theme is added, it moves to its specifier. In the [prefix root] constituent, the vocalization pattern of the prefix is established. The constituents comprising theme suffixes are prosodic domains in which a general rule (called the infinitival template) operates; this rule in effect lengthens underlying long vowels in monosyllabic infinitives.',\n",

Russian, I argue, shows the same contexts of scope fluidity as those in English, but also exhibits a previously unnoticed wide range of contexts where scope is indeed frozen. I propose a theory of scope freezing that relies on a key empirical generalization drawn from the data:  \\r\\nSF Generalization: Scope freezing results when one QP raises over another to a c-commanding position as a result of a single instance of movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing unifying all scopally frozen cases in Russian, I argue, is the presence of overt\\r\\nraising of a structurally lower QP across a higher one.  Scope freezing itself I analyze in terms of a Relation ℜ, established directly between the two QPs as the result of this overt raising operation. Thus unlike previous theories of scope freezing, my account proposes that in scope freezing cases there exists a special relation between the two QPs themselves, similar to that existing between the two QPs in an inversely linked structure, or a binding relation. I propose a possible formalization in the spirit of Stanley and Szabó (2000) and Stanley (2002) whereby nominal restriction of the lower QP is associated with a domain variable bound by the higher QP. This binding relation established due to overt crossing of QPs is what precludes the now structurally lower QP1 to raise past QP2, thus accounting for the relative nature of scope in scope freezing contexts. The SF Generalization, which is shown to be very robust, has important consequences for the Russian VP-internal argument structure debate: it suggests that Russian ditransitives are not a homogeneous group, with one argument always projected higher than the other; instead, they are subdivided into distinct classes. The detailed picture of Russian scope and scope freezing discussed in the thesis has important implications for cross-linguistic investigation of quantifier scope. It suggests that other languages may also have been misclassified into the “scopally-frozen” class.',\n",

Viewpoint aspect is a common determiner of such splits: perfective aspect is often associated with ergative alignment, while imperfective is associated with its absence (Moravcsik, 1978; Silverstein, 1976). Recent work has argued that splits arise from properties of the imperfective that disrupt otherwise-available mechanisms of ergative alignment (Laka, 2006; Coon, 2010, 2013a). This paper argues rather that the perfective can be a source of ergative case, and specifically that ergative alignment in Hindi-Urdu arises from the intersection of two different ways of expressing perfective aspect, each attested independently in other languages. The first is the use of oblique case to mark perfect or perfective subjects, and the second is a morphosyntactic sensitivity to transitivity, a hallmark of auxiliary selection in Germanic and Romance languages. The result is a more unified view of the morphosyntax of perfective aspect, though at the cost of a less unified account of aspectually split ergativity.',\n",

I propose that the temporal relations between clauses in a chain arise in part through the compositional interaction of coordination and verbal morphology that conveys relative tense. Because Northern Paiute lacks absolute tense, this can be abstracted over in a coordination structure, just as in an embedded clause in other languages (Ogihara 1994, 1995, 1996). In narratives, this semantics is enriched, I argue, by additional interpretive principles for sentences in discourse, which produce a ‘forward moving’ temporal interpretation (Kamp and Rohrer 1983, Partee 1984, Hinrichs 1986).

       "  \"The midpoint pathology (in the sense of Kager 2012) characterizes a type of unattested stress system in which stress is drawn to the middle of mid-length words, but not others. Kager (2012) shows that the pathology is an unavoidable prediction of analyses employing contextual lapse constraints (e.g. *ExtLapseR; no 000 strings at the right edge), and argues that the only way to avoid it is to eliminate these constraints in favor of weakly layered feet. I argue instead that systems exhibiting the midpoint pathology are unattested not because the constraints that would generate them are absent from Con, but because the necessary ranking is difficult to learn. This proposal has implications for metrical theory, and phonological theory more generally. If the absence of midpoint systems can be attributed to a learning difficulty, there is no need to eliminate contextual lapse constraints from Con, and Kager's (2012) argument for the necessity of weakly layered feet does not hold. More broadly, these results support the view that typology is shaped and limited by considerations of learnability (Boersma 2003, Alderete 2008, Staubs 2014). When evaluating the factorial typology of a constraint set, it is important to consider not only what is predicted to be a possible language, but also what can be learned reliably.\",\n",

While relevant, much of this discussion fails to address the sorts of facts that generative linguists often take as evidence in favor of the Universal Grammar Hypothesis: subtle, intricate, knowledge about language that speakers implicitly know without being taught.   This paper revisits a few often-cited such cases and argues that, although the facts are sometimes even more complex and subtle than is generally appreciated, appeals to Universal Grammar fail to explain the phenomena.  Instead, such facts are strongly motivated by the functions of the constructions involved.

       "  'A certain class of English adjectives known as a-adjectives resists appearing attributively as prenominal modifiers (e.g., ??the afraid boy, ??the asleep man). Boyd & Goldberg (2011) had offered experimental evidence suggesting that the dispreference is learnable on the basis of categorization and statistical preemption: repeatedly witnessing predicative formulations in contexts in which the attributive form would otherwise be appropriate. The present paper addresses Yang (2015)’s counterproposal for how a-adjectives are learned, and his instructive critique of statistical preemption.  The counterproposal is that children receive evidence that a-adjectives behave like locative particles in occurring with certain adverbs such as far and right. However, in an analysis of the 450 million word COCA corpus, the suggested adverbial evidence is virtually non-existent (e.g., *far alive; *straight afraid). In fact, these adverbs occur much more frequently with typical adjectives (e.g., far greater, straight alphabetical). Furthermore, relating a-adjectives to locative particles does not provide evidence of the restriction, because locative particles themselves can appear as prenominal modifiers (the down payment, the outside world). The critique of statistical preemption is based on a 4.3 million word corpus analysis of child directed speech that suggests that children cannot amass the requisite evidence before they are three years old. While we clarify which sorts of data are relevant to statistical preemption, we concur that the required data is relatively sparsely represented in the input. In fact, recent evidence suggests that children are not actually cognizant of the restriction until they are roughly ten years old, an indication that input of an order of magnitude more than 4.3 million words may be required. We conclude that a combination of categorization and statistical preemption is consistent with the available evidence of how the restriction on a-adjectives is learned.',\n",

       "  'The striking parallels across languages in the syntactic expression of “argument structure” broadly construed has led within generative grammar, at least since Generative Semantics, to generative theories that demand a kind of transparent reflection of argument structure in underlying syntactic representations. This trend is reflected in approaches oriented around thematic roles, such as those that adopt some version of UTAH, as well as event-structure oriented approaches like that in Ramchand 2008 in which, in a sense, event structure is underlying syntactic structure. An alternative approach attributes the relative uniformity of the expression of argument structure to the principles that interpret syntactic structure semantically; here, syntax is truly autonomous, with the atoms of syntactic representations and their relations carrying no semantic values. On this alternative approach, we might expect that the same meanings could be expressed by different syntactic structures and that the same syntactic structures might express different meanings.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn this chapter, we present an account of the heads that add participants to events.  Within current theories, these heads are usually identified as voice, appl, and prepositions, as well as little v for some linguists, where the causative little v head might introduce an agent or causer. We will follow Pylkkänen (2008), Harley (2013) and Legate (2014) among others, in arguing that little v does not, by itself, introduce an argument, so our account will focus primarily on the voice, appl, and prepositional heads. We will argue that syntactic heads crucially involved in the interpretation of argument structure – heads like v, voice, p and appl – are subject to contextual allosemy at the semantic interface such that each such head may have a particular range of meanings, including a null (expletive) meaning, depending on the syntactic context. Once syntactic heads are absolved from the necessity of carrying certain features relevant to their interpretation explicitly, when the features are rather computed contextually at the point of semantic interpretation, we can develop a sparse inventory of functional heads for the syntax.

       "  \"Male putty-nosed monkeys have two main alarm calls, pyows and hacks. While pyows have a broad distribution suggestive of a general call, hacks are often indicative of eagles. In a series of articles, Arnold and Zuberbühler showed that putty-nosed monkeys sometimes produce distinct pyow-hack sequences made of a small number of pyows followed by a small number of hacks; and that these are predictive of group movement. Arnold and Zuberbühler claimed that pyow-hack sequences are syntactically combinatorial but not semantically compositional because their meaning can't be derived from the meanings of their component parts. We compare two theories of this phenomenon. One formalizes and modifies the non-compositional theory. The other presents a semantically compositional alternative based on weak meanings for pyow ('general alarm') and hack ('non-ground movement'), combined with pragmatic principles of competition; a crucial one is an 'Urgency Principle' whereby calls that provide information about the nature/location of a threat must come before calls that don't. Semantically, pyow-hack sequences are compatible with any kind of situation involving (moving) aerial predators or (arboreal) movement of the monkeys themselves. But in the former case, hacks provide information about the location of a threat, and hence should appear at the beginning of sequences. As a result, pyow-hack sequences can only be used for non-threat-related situations involving movement, hence a possible inference that they involve group movement. Without adjudicating the debate, we argue that a formal analysis can help clarify competing theories and derive new predictions that might decide between them.\",\n",

       "  'Examining the gender systems in Mainland Scandinavian, I argue that a strict division has to be made between three dimensions of gender: formal gender, semantic gender, and lexical gender. Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, basic to human cognition, and conveyed by pronominal resources. Examples of semantic genders are masculine, feminine, countable, non-countable, animate, and non-animate. Formal gender is – synchronically – phonology and thus syntactically inert. This means that there is no Formal Gender Phrase or the like in the syntactic tree. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which blurs the picture.\\r\\nThe formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but may be used for the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example animate – inanimate. Of particular importance is the idea that neuter is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of number, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. A pragmatic effect is that neuter in such contexts corresponds to non-countability. In adjectival agreement, however, formal gender is more or less ornamental. Agreement on adjectives is a phonological wellformedness criterion, and if no other source to agreement is available, agreement will be in formal gender.\\r\\nDrawing on work done in the 80s (primarily Bosch 1983; 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (3C) and det (3N) are carefully discussed in this study. It is shown that these pronouns can be used as Syn-pronouns, that is for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally common gender or neuter, but also as Ref-pronoun, to make reference to countable or non-countable discourse entities.\\r\\nThe analyses are based on Mainland Scandinavian, but an outlook is made to some related languages.',\n",

Kuhn concludes that sign language loci are an open class of features rather than of variables; and he provides a variable-free treatment of them, although without accounting for their deictic uses. While granting the correctness of Kuhn's Generalization, we offer an alternative in which loci are both features and variables: some loci (in particular deictic ones) obtain their value from an assignment function, and introduce presuppositions on the value of other (covert) variables; but loci are also subject to the same rules of agreement as phi-features, and thus remain uninterpreted in other environments.

These projections host sentence final particles (SFP) or null operators. When the compared projections are both head-final, the syntactic word order reflects the relevant hierarchy; when the compared projections are not uniformly head-final, their scope interaction reflects the order. This study shows that the higher a projection, the more subjective its interpretation and the harder it can be embedded. For instance, being subject-oriented sentential aspects and only-type focus are not directly linked to the speaker’s attitude and therefore, they can be embedded and be interpreted within the subordinate clause. As for the SFPs linked to illocutionary forces, some can be embedded, while others cannot. Special questions and the SFPs expressing the speaker’s mood, interjection and attitude cannot be embedded at all. This fact is regarded as an indirect argument in favor of my proposal.\",\n",

With the VP complementation approach, I assume that a restructur- ing complement contains a syntactically and semantically independent VP. In contrast to the bare VP complementation approach, however, I propose that restructuring complements also involve a voice head (but no embedded subject). Motivation for a voice head in restructuring comes from the subject interpreta- tion of the embedded predicate, German stem allomorphy, and voice marking in several Austronesian languages. This hybrid account has the advantage that argument structure ‘sharing’ only applies to the subject of a restructuring configuration, whereas the remaining argument and event structure properties of the matrix and embedded VPs remain separate, which is supported by cross-linguistic properties pointing to the morphological, syntactic, and semantic independence of the two VPs.

In the French example 'Anne croit qu’on va la lui recommander pour la promotion' (‘Anna thinks that they will recommend her to him for the promotion’), the accusative clitic 'la' (‘her’) in the embedded clause cannot corefer with ‘Anne’ when a dative clitic, 'lui' (‘to him'), co-occurs in the cluster. The only previous account of this constraint (Bhatt and Šimík 2009) attributes this to a binding restriction. Based on new data disentangling binding and logophoricity, we show that the generalization capturing the distribution of clitics clusters in French and Spanish is the following: an accusative clitic cannot be clustered with a dative clitic if the accusative clitic refers to a logophoric center and is read de se. We derive this antilogophoricity effect from perspective conflicts, which we represent as intervention effects in the presence of a single logophoric operator in the relevant domain. This analysis furthermore provides a semantic motivation for intervention effects that have been postulated for the Person-Case Constraint (PCC), which we hypothesize also derives from perspective conflicts.\",\n",

The minority vowel-initial pattern, “Attic Reduplication,” both its shape and its distribution, can be explained as a phonotactic repair which operated at a prior stage of the language. This pattern was later reanalyzed, such that Attic Reduplication is retained not as a phonotactic repair but rather through lexical indexation.',\n",

A goal feature is simply a uF that can find no match in its complement. I propose that before the point of phasal transfer, DELAYED VALUATION of uFs is possible either in situ within the same phase; or ex situ, by raising to c-command a potential valuer in a higher phase. uCase is a feature of D that finds no match in its complement NP, and therefore relies on DELAYED VALUATION in situ or by movement depending on the distance from a Case-licensor (see Bobaljik & Wurmbrand 2005 on two ways of valuing German nominative). The analysis of Case-driven movement converges in important respects with proposals of Boskovic (2007, 2011) while nonetheless permitting the attested in situ strategy.\\r\\n \\r\\nThough the paper contributes to Case theory, its empirical core is a difference between West Germanic (WG) and Lubukusu complementizer agreement (CA) (see Haegeman 1992, Carstens 2003, Haegeman & van Koppen 2010 on the former; Diercks 2010 and to appear on the latter). WG CA reflects the features of the embedded subject, while Lubukusu CA agrees with the subject of the higher clause. I argue that WG CA is the low complementizer Finite in the cartography of Rizzi (1997); it can therefore probe the embedded subject upon Merge. In contrast Lubukusu’s agreeing C is the high, phasal complementizer Force, Merged after the subject is transferred to PF, so like uCase it finds no value in its complement. I argue that uPhi of Force obtains values by raising of ForceP to an outer Spec, vP for DELAYED VALUATION from the matrix subject. The movement analysis is motivated by the fact that uPhi of Force agree with the subject even when ForceP is Merged within the VP complement to a phasal Applicative head (cf. McGinnis 2001). Absent raising, ForceP would be transferred to PF unvalued. The applied object (IO) itself cannot value uPhi of Force, I argue, because Lubukusu subjects and IOs contrast in that the latter are Case-licensed in situ (cf. Halpert 2011) while the former are not; hence IOs are “deactivated” and cannot value Lubukusu agreeing C.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter presenting the analysis of contrasting complementizer agreement varieties and developing the theory of DELAYED VALUATION, my paper explores German nominative in detail and then relates the proposals to agreement displacement (cf. Bejar & Rezac 2009), creating a unified approach. Lastly I argue, somewhat speculatively, that raising of a uF to be closest c-commandee may suffice to provide DELAYED VALUATION. Directionality of search arises always and only for derivational reasons at first Merge (Epstein 1998); hence the conclusion in (1):\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) MECHANICS OF DELAYED VALUATION: uF with no match in its c-command domain at Merge may be valued:\\r\\n\\r\\n(i) Ex situ, by raising into locality with a matching feature in a higher phase, OR\\r\\n(ii) In situ, by a matching feature within the same phase.',\n",

This paper provides support for this general picture by presenting parsing evidence for the intermediate traces created by successive-cyclic movement.

The central findings of this paper are (i) that successive-cyclic movement targets the edge of finite clauses and (ii) that no intermediate landing sites exist at the edges of (extended) VPs. These conclusions are fully consistent with traditional characterizations of successive-cyclicity but at variance with more recent approaches that hold that even movement within a single clause is successive-cyclic. A reassessment of arguments put forth in support of the latter hypothesis reveals them to be less compelling than they are standardly taken to be, which provides converging evidence for the parsing conclusions reached here.

In this paper, I show that word-word compounds and stressed aﬃx + word structures exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerences in stress assignment in BP, which supports their prosodization in two separate domains. While stressed aﬃx + word structures are assigned primary and secondary stress as simple phonological words (PWds), each element in word-word compounds behaves as an independent PWd with regard to stress assignment. I thus propose that while stressed aﬃx + word structures are recursively prosodized in the PWd domain, word-word compounds are prosodized in the composite group, the domain proposed by Vogel (2008, 2009) that immediately dominates the PWd and accounts for the prosodization of structures with compositional characteristics. My analysis reconciles two views on prosodic structure that are traditionally assumed to be mutually exclusive: the view that prosodic domains can be recursive (e.g. Inkelas (1990), Selkirk (1996)) and the view that the prosodic hierarchy includes an additional domain speciﬁc to composite structures above the PWd (e.g Vogel (2009)).',\n",

Both outside negation and subjective epistemic modals resist embedding under veridicals, semi-factives and proffering predicates, induce Epistemic Containment, and exhibit further peculiar scope-freezing effects. We argue that these phenomena can be given a unified treatment in terms of the scopal properties of subjective epistemic attitudes, once it is assumed that factive and veridical predicates, as well as verbs of proffering, force their complement to be closed off by a factive operator, irrespective of whether that complement is a proposition or a question (see Spector and Égré 2015 for related ideas). The proposed account relies on a theory of scope in which scope shift is encoded through percolation of scope indices constrained by a minimality condition (the Condition on Scope Shift; Neeleman & Van de Koot 2012). Therefore, to the extent that the account presented is successful, it provides support for this particular view of scope-taking.',\n",

The openness parameter is used in the current IPA system, in which vowels are classified into four categories: “close” vs. “close-mid” vs. “open-mid” vs. “open”. In order to quantitatively examine this concept of openness in detail, the current paper presents an articulatory study using EMA (ElectroMagnetic Articulograph) with Japanese as the target language. The main aim of this experiment is to provide exact measures of the amount of jaw opening of the five vowels in Japanese, and to investigate how the results would bear on the abstract concept of vowel openness. Our results show that while the traditional labeling of openness is more or less correct, we also observe that between the vowels of the same openness, front vowels are more open than back vowels (e.g. [e] is more open than [o]). Our results thus provide some information that goes beyond what the current IPA description of Japanese offers (Okada, 1999). We also examine the acoustic correlates of vowel openness, and compare them to jaw opening patterns. The result shows that, unsurprisingly, F1 is the most reliable correlate of vowel openness, but that other secondary cues, such as duration, F0, and intensity, are not very reliable, at least when measured in our task format.',\n",

The aim is to show that under this form of grammar, the syntactic insights of Minimalism and Principles & Parameters theory can be obtained in more restrictive and more explanatory fashion.

The goal of this paper is to open the discussion by advancing a proposal about the nature of empirical evidence in research on meaning. Our proposal is based primarily on insights we and our colleagues have gained in research on under-studied languages and in quantitative research using offline measures, but we intend the proposal to cover research on natural language meaning more broadly, including research on well- studied languages that the researcher may even control natively.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur proposal has three parts. First, we argue that a complete piece of data in research on meaning consists of a linguistic expression, a context in which the expression is uttered, a response by a native speaker to a task involving the expression in that context, and information about the native speakers that provided the responses. Incomplete pieces of data fail to satisfy our three proposed objectives that data be stable, replicable and transparent. Second, we argue that some response tasks, namely acceptability and implication judgment tasks, are better suited than others (e.g., paraphrase and translation tasks) for yielding stable, replicable and transparent pieces of data. Finally, we argue that empirical evidence for a hypothesis about meaning consists of one positive piece of data, or two pieces in minimal pair form, plus a linking hypothesis about how the piece(s) of data provide support for the meaning hypothesis. We show that different types of minimal pairs provide evidence for different types of meaning hypotheses.',\n",

       "  'Brazilian Portuguese pronominal and non-pronominal clitics are generally assumed to undergo the same phonological phenomena. Both show vowel raising and vowel sandhi with the initial vowel of the host and thus differ from unstressed monosyllabic prefixes, which are not expected to undergo such processes (Bisol, 2000, 2005). However, an analysis of vowel raising in pronominal clitic se (3SG/PL.REFL/INDET/PASS) and non-pronominal clitic se (‘if’) shows that the phenomenon is significantly more frequent in non-pronominal se. This fact, as well as morphosyntactic distinctions between these two categories of clitics, indicates that pronominal and non-pronominal clitics are mapped onto the prosodic hierarchy in two separate domains. While non-pronominal clitics are prosodized in the phonological phrase (PPh), pronominal clitics are prosodized in the composite group (CG; Vogel (2009)), the domain between the phonological word (PWd) and the PPh onto which structures with compositional characteristics are prosodically mapped.',\n",

If our analysis is on the right track, any analysis of segmental phonology like palatalization potentially requires an understanding of syntax and semantics. The findings are interesting because they suggest that surface-oriented phonological processes within a word are constrained by the same universal principles as superficially unrelated phenomena like locality constraints on syntactic displacement; island constraints and palatalization may play by the same rules.',\n",

A raised category must stop in the position where it completes the valuation of all of its own unvalued features, which corresponds to the Criterial Position. In the Halting Problem, a wh-object agrees with the embedded C that has Q and is frozen in that Spec. In the Empty Category Principle, a wh-subject should in principle move across a declarative complementizer, since Agree does not occur between the wh-subject and the embedded C that does not have Q. The violation of the Empty Category Principle is not idiosyncratic any longer, with the that-trace effect attributed to the matter of phonology. In the Extended Projection Principle, a subject must move to [Spec,TP] to value its own unvalued Case feature, since the latter cannot be valued by v*. With the subject located in [Spec,TP] both in English and in Italian, whether an overt subject is required or not is attributed to the requirement from the phonological component. I argue that this unified account derives from one of the corollaries of the derivational system based on Labeling Algorithm: labeling results from feature valuation in crucial cases.',\n",

We collected data from 24 respondents in Malta, Tunis and Benghazi which we analyzed to determine that there exists asymmetric mutual intelligibility between the two mainstream varieties of Maġribī Arabic and Maltese, where speakers of Tunisian and Libyan Arabic are able to understand about 40% of what is being said to them in Maltese, whereas that ratio is about 30% for speakers of Maltese exposed to either variety of Arabic. Additionally, we found that Tunisian Arabic has the highest level of mutual intelligibility with either of the other two varieties. Combining the intelligibility scores with comparative linguistic data, we were able to sketch out the phonological variables involved in enabling and inhibiting mutual intelligibility for all three varieties of Arabic and set stage for further research into the subject.',\n",

Specifically, a locality condition prevents movement in control constructions across the boundaries of a tensed or a phi-fully specified clause, namely a CP phase as movement is blocked by a topicalized element. In the same vein, clitic climbing is prevented to operate across a v* as it is blocked by focused elements.

I analyze these indefinites as contrastive topics, using Büring’s (1999) theory. I propose that the topic is evaluated in relation to a scalar set including generalized quantifiers such as {\\uf06cP \\uf024x P(x), \\uf06cP MANYx P(x), \\uf06cP MOSTx P(x), \\uf06cP \\uf022xP(x)} or {\\uf06cP \\uf024xP(x), \\uf06cP P(a), \\uf06cP P(b) ...}.

The speaker asserts that his claim is certainly true or highly probable, contrasting it with stronger claims for which the degree of probability is unknown. This explains the observation that in downward entailing contexts, the fronted quantified DPs are headed by ‘all’ or ‘many’, whereas ‘some(thing)’, small numbers or ‘at least n’ appear in upward entailing contexts. Unlike other cases of non-specific topics, which are property topics, these are quantifier topics: the topic part is a generalized quantifier, the comment is a property of generalized quantifiers.
